    77	To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
    78	
    79	I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
    80	
    81	One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
    82	
    83	His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
    84	
    85	"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
    86	
    87	"Seven!" I answered.
    88	
    89	"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
    90	
    91	"Then, how do you know?"
    92	
    93	"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"
    94	
    95	"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
    96	
    97	He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
    98	
    99	"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."
   100	
   101	I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
   102	
   103	"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
   104	
   105	"Frequently."
   106	
   107	"How often?"
   108	
   109	"Well, some hundreds of times."
   110	
   111	"Then how many are there?"
   112	
   113	"How many? I don't know."
   114	
   115	"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
   116	
   117	The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
   118	
   119	"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
   120	
   121	"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"
   122	
   123	"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"
   124	
   125	I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
   126	
   127	"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."
   128	
   129	"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
   130	
   131	I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
   132	
   133	"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
   134	
   135	"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
   136	
   137	"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
   138	
   139	"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
   140	
   141	"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
   142	
   143	As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.
   144	
   145	"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
   146	
   147	"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
   148	
   149	"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."
   150	
   151	"But your client--"
   152	
   153	"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."
   154	
   155	A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
   156	
   157	"Come in!" said Holmes.
   158	
   159	A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
   160	
   161	"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
   162	
   163	"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
   164	
   165	"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."
   166	
   167	I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
   168	
   169	The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."
   170	
   171	"I promise," said Holmes.
   172	
   173	"And I."
   174	
   175	"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."
   176	
   177	"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
   178	
   179	"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
   180	
   181	"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
   182	
   183	Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
   184	
   185	"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
   186	
   187	The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
   188	
   189	"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."
   190	
   191	"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."
   192	
   193	"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
   194	
   195	"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
   196	
   197	"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
   198	
   199	"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."
   200	
   201	"Precisely so. But how--"
   202	
   203	"Was there a secret marriage?"
   204	
   205	"None."
   206	
   207	"No legal papers or certificates?"
   208	
   209	"None."
   210	
   211	"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"
   212	
   213	"There is the writing."
   214	
   215	"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."
   216	
   217	"My private note-paper."
   218	
   219	"Stolen."
   220	
   221	"My own seal."
   222	
   223	"Imitated."
   224	
   225	"My photograph."
   226	
   227	"Bought."
   228	
   229	"We were both in the photograph."
   230	
   231	"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."
   232	
   233	"I was mad--insane."
   234	
   235	"You have compromised yourself seriously."
   236	
   237	"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
   238	
   239	"It must be recovered."
   240	
   241	"We have tried and failed."
   242	
   243	"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."
   244	
   245	"She will not sell."
   246	
   247	"Stolen, then."
   248	
   249	"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."
   250	
   251	"No sign of it?"
   252	
   253	"Absolutely none."
   254	
   255	Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
   256	
   257	"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
   258	
   259	"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"
   260	
   261	"To ruin me."
   262	
   263	"But how?"
   264	
   265	"I am about to be married."
   266	
   267	"So I have heard."
   268	
   269	"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
   270	
   271	"And Irene Adler?"
   272	
   273	"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."
   274	
   275	"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
   276	
   277	"I am sure."
   278	
   279	"And why?"
   280	
   281	"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
   282	
   283	"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"
   284	
   285	"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."
   286	
   287	"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
   288	
   289	"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
   290	
   291	"Then, as to money?"
   292	
   293	"You have carte blanche."
   294	
   295	"Absolutely?"
   296	
   297	"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."
   298	
   299	"And for present expenses?"
   300	
   301	The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
   302	
   303	"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.
   304	
   305	Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.
   306	
   307	"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
   308	
   309	"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
   310	
   311	Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"
   312	
   313	"It was."
   314	
   315	"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
   316	
   317	II.
   318	
   319	
   320	At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
   321	
   322	It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
   323	
   324	"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
   325	
   326	"What is it?"
   327	
   328	"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
   329	
   330	"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
   331	
   332	"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
   333	
   334	"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
   335	
   336	"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
   337	
   338	"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
   339	
   340	"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."
   341	
   342	"I am following you closely," I answered.
   343	
   344	"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
   345	
   346	"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'
   347	
   348	"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
   349	
   350	" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
   351	
   352	"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
   353	
   354	"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
   355	
   356	" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
   357	
   358	" 'What then?' I asked.
   359	
   360	" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
   361	
   362	"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."
   363	
   364	"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"
   365	
   366	"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."
   367	
   368	"Which are?"
   369	
   370	"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."
   371	
   372	"I shall be delighted."
   373	
   374	"You don't mind breaking the law?"
   375	
   376	"Not in the least."
   377	
   378	"Nor running a chance of arrest?"
   379	
   380	"Not in a good cause."
   381	
   382	"Oh, the cause is excellent!"
   383	
   384	"Then I am your man."
   385	
   386	"I was sure that I might rely on you."
   387	
   388	"But what is it you wish?"
   389	
   390	"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
   391	
   392	"And what then?"
   393	
   394	"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
   395	
   396	"I am to be neutral?"
   397	
   398	"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."
   399	
   400	"Yes."
   401	
   402	"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
   403	
   404	"Yes."
   405	
   406	"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"
   407	
   408	"Entirely."
   409	
   410	"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
   411	
   412	"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
   413	
   414	"Precisely."
   415	
   416	"Then you may entirely rely on me."
   417	
   418	"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."
   419	
   420	He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
   421	
   422	It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
   423	
   424	"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"
   425	
   426	"Where, indeed?"
   427	
   428	"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
   429	
   430	"Where, then?"
   431	
   432	"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
   433	
   434	"But it has twice been burgled."
   435	
   436	"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
   437	
   438	"But how will you look?"
   439	
   440	"I will not look."
   441	
   442	"What then?"
   443	
   444	"I will get her to show me."
   445	
   446	"But she will refuse."
   447	
   448	"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
   449	
   450	As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.
   451	
   452	"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
   453	
   454	"He is dead," cried several voices.
   455	
   456	"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."
   457	
   458	"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
   459	
   460	"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
   461	
   462	"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"
   463	
   464	Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.
   465	
   466	Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
   467	
   468	"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."
   469	
   470	"You have the photograph?"
   471	
   472	"I know where it is."
   473	
   474	"And how did you find out?"
   475	
   476	"She showed me, as I told you she would."
   477	
   478	"I am still in the dark."
   479	
   480	"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
   481	
   482	"I guessed as much."
   483	
   484	"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
   485	
   486	"That also I could fathom."
   487	
   488	"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."
   489	
   490	"How did that help you?"
   491	
   492	"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
   493	
   494	"And now?" I asked.
   495	
   496	"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."
   497	
   498	"And when will you call?"
   499	
   500	"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."
   501	
   502	We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
   503	
   504	"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
   505	
   506	There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
   507	
   508	"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."
   509	
   510	III.
   511	
   512	
   513	I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
   514	
   515	"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
   516	
   517	"Not yet."
   518	
   519	"But you have hopes?"
   520	
   521	"I have hopes."
   522	
   523	"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
   524	
   525	"We must have a cab."
   526	
   527	"No, my brougham is waiting."
   528	
   529	"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.
   530	
   531	"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
   532	
   533	"Married! When?"
   534	
   535	"Yesterday."
   536	
   537	"But to whom?"
   538	
   539	"To an English lawyer named Norton."
   540	
   541	"But she could not love him."
   542	
   543	"I am in hopes that she does."
   544	
   545	"And why in hopes?"
   546	
   547	"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
   548	
   549	"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
   550	
   551	The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
   552	
   553	"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
   554	
   555	"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
   556	
   557	"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."
   558	
   559	"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
   560	
   561	"Never to return."
   562	
   563	"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
   564	
   565	"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
   566	
   567	"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
   568	
   569	"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.
   570	
   571	"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
   572	
   573	
   574	"Very truly yours,              
   575	"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."
   576	
   577	"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
   578	
   579	"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."
   580	
   581	"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
   582	
   583	"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
   584	
   585	"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
   586	
   587	"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
   588	
   589	"You have but to name it."
   590	
   591	"This photograph!"
   592	
   593	The King stared at him in amazement.
   594	
   595	"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
   596	
   597	"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
   598	
   599	And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

   601	ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
   602	
   603	
   604	I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
   605	
   606	"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.
   607	
   608	"I was afraid that you were engaged."
   609	
   610	"So I am. Very much so."
   611	
   612	"Then I can wait in the next room."
   613	
   614	"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
   615	
   616	The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
   617	
   618	"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."
   619	
   620	"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.
   621	
   622	"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."
   623	
   624	"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
   625	
   626	"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
   627	
   628	The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
   629	
   630	I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.
   631	
   632	Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
   633	
   634	Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
   635	
   636	"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."
   637	
   638	"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."
   639	
   640	"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
   641	
   642	"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
   643	
   644	"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
   645	
   646	"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
   647	
   648	"Well, but China?"
   649	
   650	"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."
   651	
   652	Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."
   653	
   654	"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
   655	
   656	"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
   657	
   658	I took the paper from him and read as follows:
   659	
   660	"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
   661	
   662	"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.
   663	
   664	Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."
   665	
   666	"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."
   667	
   668	"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
   669	
   670	"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."
   671	
   672	"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
   673	
   674	"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
   675	
   676	"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."
   677	
   678	"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."
   679	
   680	"He is still with you, I presume?"
   681	
   682	"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
   683	
   684	"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
   685	
   686	" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
   687	
   688	" 'Why that?' I asks.
   689	
   690	" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
   691	
   692	" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
   693	
   694	" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.
   695	
   696	" 'Never.'
   697	
   698	" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'
   699	
   700	" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.
   701	
   702	" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'
   703	
   704	"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
   705	
   706	" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.
   707	
   708	" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'
   709	
   710	" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'
   711	
   712	" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'
   713	
   714	"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
   715	
   716	"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."
   717	
   718	"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
   719	
   720	"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
   721	
   722	" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
   723	
   724	" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
   725	
   726	" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
   727	
   728	" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
   729	
   730	"I answered that I had not.
   731	
   732	"His face fell immediately.
   733	
   734	" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'
   735	
   736	"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
   737	
   738	" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'
   739	
   740	" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.
   741	
   742	" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'
   743	
   744	" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.
   745	
   746	" 'Ten to two.'
   747	
   748	"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.
   749	
   750	" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'
   751	
   752	" 'Is $4 a week.'
   753	
   754	" 'And the work?'
   755	
   756	" 'Is purely nominal.'
   757	
   758	" 'What do you call purely nominal?'
   759	
   760	" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'
   761	
   762	" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.
   763	
   764	" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'
   765	
   766	" 'And the work?'
   767	
   768	" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'
   769	
   770	" 'Certainly,' I answered.
   771	
   772	" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.
   773	
   774	"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.
   775	
   776	"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.
   777	
   778	"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
   779	
   780	"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."
   781	
   782	"To an end?"
   783	
   784	"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
   785	
   786	He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:
   787	
   788	
   789	THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
   790	
   791	IS
   792	
   793	DISSOLVED.
   794	
   795	October 9, 1890.
   796	
   797	
   798	Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.
   799	
   800	"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
   801	
   802	"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"
   803	
   804	"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
   805	
   806	" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
   807	
   808	" 'What, the red-headed man?'
   809	
   810	" 'Yes.'
   811	
   812	" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
   813	
   814	" 'Where could I find him?'
   815	
   816	" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
   817	
   818	"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
   819	
   820	"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
   821	
   822	"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."
   823	
   824	"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
   825	
   826	"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."
   827	
   828	"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."
   829	
   830	"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."
   831	
   832	"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"
   833	
   834	"About a month then."
   835	
   836	"How did he come?"
   837	
   838	"In answer to an advertisement."
   839	
   840	"Was he the only applicant?"
   841	
   842	"No, I had a dozen."
   843	
   844	"Why did you pick him?"
   845	
   846	"Because he was handy and would come cheap."
   847	
   848	"At half wages, in fact."
   849	
   850	"Yes."
   851	
   852	"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
   853	
   854	"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
   855	
   856	Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
   857	
   858	"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."
   859	
   860	"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"
   861	
   862	"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
   863	
   864	"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
   865	
   866	"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."
   867	
   868	"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
   869	
   870	"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"
   871	
   872	"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."
   873	
   874	"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."
   875	
   876	"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
   877	
   878	"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
   879	
   880	"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
   881	
   882	"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."
   883	
   884	"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
   885	
   886	We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
   887	
   888	"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."
   889	
   890	"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
   891	
   892	"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."
   893	
   894	"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
   895	
   896	"Not him."
   897	
   898	"What then?"
   899	
   900	"The knees of his trousers."
   901	
   902	"And what did you see?"
   903	
   904	"What I expected to see."
   905	
   906	"Why did you beat the pavement?"
   907	
   908	"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
   909	
   910	The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
   911	
   912	"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
   913	
   914	My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
   915	
   916	"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.
   917	
   918	"Yes, it would be as well."
   919	
   920	"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."
   921	
   922	"Why serious?"
   923	
   924	"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."
   925	
   926	"At what time?"
   927	
   928	"Ten will be early enough."
   929	
   930	"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
   931	
   932	"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
   933	
   934	I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
   935	
   936	It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
   937	
   938	"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."
   939	
   940	"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."
   941	
   942	"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
   943	
   944	"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."
   945	
   946	"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."
   947	
   948	"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
   949	
   950	"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
   951	
   952	"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."
   953	
   954	Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
   955	
   956	"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."
   957	
   958	We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
   959	
   960	"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
   961	
   962	"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
   963	
   964	"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
   965	
   966	The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
   967	
   968	"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."
   969	
   970	"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
   971	
   972	"Your French gold?"
   973	
   974	"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
   975	
   976	"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
   977	
   978	"And sit in the dark?"
   979	
   980	"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."
   981	
   982	I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.
   983	
   984	"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"
   985	
   986	"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
   987	
   988	"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."
   989	
   990	What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
   991	
   992	At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.
   993	
   994	Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
   995	
   996	"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
   997	
   998	Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
   999	
  1000	"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."
  1001	
  1002	"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."
  1003	
  1004	"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
  1005	
  1006	"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."
  1007	
  1008	"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."
  1009	
  1010	"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."
  1011	
  1012	"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "
  1013	
  1014	"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"
  1015	
  1016	"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
  1017	
  1018	"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
  1019	
  1020	"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
  1021	
  1022	"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."
  1023	
  1024	"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
  1025	
  1026	"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.
  1027	
  1028	"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."
  1029	
  1030	"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.
  1031	
  1032	"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
  1033	
  1034	"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."
  1035	
  1036	"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."
  1037	
  1038	"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
  1039	
  1040	He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
  1041	
  1042	ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY
  1043	
  1044	
  1045	"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."
  1046	
  1047	"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."
  1048	
  1049	"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
  1050	
  1051	I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."
  1052	
  1053	"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."
  1054	
  1055	He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
  1056	
  1057	"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
  1058	
  1059	"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
  1060	
  1061	"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."
  1062	
  1063	"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
  1064	
  1065	"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
  1066	
  1067	He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.
  1068	
  1069	"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
  1070	
  1071	As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
  1072	
  1073	"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"
  1074	
  1075	"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"
  1076	
  1077	"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
  1078	
  1079	"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  1080	
  1081	"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
  1082	
  1083	Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."
  1084	
  1085	"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."
  1086	
  1087	"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
  1088	
  1089	"And your mother is alive?"
  1090	
  1091	"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
  1092	
  1093	I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
  1094	
  1095	"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"
  1096	
  1097	"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."
  1098	
  1099	"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."
  1100	
  1101	"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
  1102	
  1103	"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  1104	
  1105	A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  1106	
  1107	"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
  1108	
  1109	"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
  1110	
  1111	"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  1112	
  1113	"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."
  1114	
  1115	"No?"
  1116	
  1117	"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
  1118	
  1119	"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"
  1120	
  1121	"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."
  1122	
  1123	"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
  1124	
  1125	"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"
  1126	
  1127	"What office?"
  1128	
  1129	"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
  1130	
  1131	"Where did he live, then?"
  1132	
  1133	"He slept on the premises."
  1134	
  1135	"And you don't know his address?"
  1136	
  1137	"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
  1138	
  1139	"Where did you address your letters, then?"
  1140	
  1141	"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."
  1142	
  1143	"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
  1144	
  1145	"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
  1146	
  1147	"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"
  1148	
  1149	"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."
  1150	
  1151	"It missed him, then?"
  1152	
  1153	"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
  1154	
  1155	"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
  1156	
  1157	"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
  1158	
  1159	"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.
  1160	
  1161	"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."
  1162	
  1163	"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
  1164	
  1165	"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."
  1166	
  1167	"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
  1168	
  1169	"None."
  1170	
  1171	"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
  1172	
  1173	"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."
  1174	
  1175	"And your father? Did you tell him?"
  1176	
  1177	"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.
  1178	
  1179	"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
  1180	
  1181	"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
  1182	
  1183	"I fear not."
  1184	
  1185	"Then what has happened to him?"
  1186	
  1187	"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."
  1188	
  1189	"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
  1190	
  1191	"Thank you. And your address?"
  1192	
  1193	"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
  1194	
  1195	"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"
  1196	
  1197	"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."
  1198	
  1199	"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."
  1200	
  1201	"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
  1202	
  1203	For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
  1204	
  1205	Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
  1206	
  1207	"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."
  1208	
  1209	"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.
  1210	
  1211	"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."
  1212	
  1213	"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."
  1214	
  1215	Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
  1216	
  1217	" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."
  1218	
  1219	"It surprised me."
  1220	
  1221	"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
  1222	
  1223	"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.
  1224	
  1225	"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
  1226	
  1227	I held the little printed slip to the light.
  1228	
  1229	"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
  1230	
  1231	"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."
  1232	
  1233	"They are typewritten," I remarked.
  1234	
  1235	"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."
  1236	
  1237	"Of what?"
  1238	
  1239	"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"
  1240	
  1241	"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."
  1242	
  1243	"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."
  1244	
  1245	I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
  1246	
  1247	I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
  1248	
  1249	A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
  1250	
  1251	"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
  1252	
  1253	"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
  1254	
  1255	"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
  1256	
  1257	"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
  1258	
  1259	"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"
  1260	
  1261	The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.
  1262	
  1263	"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"
  1264	
  1265	The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
  1266	
  1267	"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"
  1268	
  1269	"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
  1270	
  1271	"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  1272	
  1273	Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.
  1274	
  1275	"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
  1276	
  1277	"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
  1278	
  1279	"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
  1280	
  1281	Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."
  1282	
  1283	"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
  1284	
  1285	"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
  1286	
  1287	"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
  1288	
  1289	Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.
  1290	
  1291	"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
  1292	
  1293	The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
  1294	
  1295	"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."
  1296	
  1297	"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."
  1298	
  1299	"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"
  1300	
  1301	Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.
  1302	
  1303	"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."
  1304	
  1305	"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
  1306	
  1307	"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."
  1308	
  1309	"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.
  1310	
  1311	"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."
  1312	
  1313	"And how did you verify them?"
  1314	
  1315	"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"
  1316	
  1317	"And Miss Sutherland?"
  1318	
  1319	"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."
  1320	
  1321	ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
  1322	
  1323	
  1324	We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:
  1325	
  1326	"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
  1327	
  1328	"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"
  1329	
  1330	"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."
  1331	
  1332	"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
  1333	
  1334	"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."
  1335	
  1336	My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
  1337	
  1338	"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."
  1339	
  1340	We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
  1341	
  1342	"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
  1343	
  1344	"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
  1345	
  1346	"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
  1347	
  1348	"That sounds a little paradoxical."
  1349	
  1350	"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."
  1351	
  1352	"It is a murder, then?"
  1353	
  1354	"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.
  1355	
  1356	"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.
  1357	
  1358	"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.
  1359	
  1360	"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
  1361	
  1362	"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."
  1363	
  1364	"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."
  1365	
  1366	"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."
  1367	
  1368	"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."
  1369	
  1370	"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."
  1371	
  1372	"How on earth--"
  1373	
  1374	"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."
  1375	
  1376	"What are they?"
  1377	
  1378	"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."
  1379	
  1380	"It was a confession," I ejaculated.
  1381	
  1382	"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
  1383	
  1384	"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."
  1385	
  1386	"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."
  1387	
  1388	I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.
  1389	
  1390	"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
  1391	
  1392	"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
  1393	
  1394	"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
  1395	
  1396	He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:
  1397	
  1398	"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
  1399	
  1400	"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
  1401	
  1402	"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.
  1403	
  1404	"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
  1405	
  1406	"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.
  1407	
  1408	"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
  1409	
  1410	"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
  1411	
  1412	"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
  1413	
  1414	"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
  1415	
  1416	"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
  1417	
  1418	"Witness: I must still refuse.
  1419	
  1420	"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?
  1421	
  1422	"Witness: It was.
  1423	
  1424	"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
  1425	
  1426	"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
  1427	
  1428	"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
  1429	
  1430	"Witness: Nothing definite.
  1431	
  1432	"The Coroner: What do you mean?
  1433	
  1434	"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.
  1435	
  1436	" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'
  1437	
  1438	" 'Yes, it was gone.'
  1439	
  1440	" 'You cannot say what it was?'
  1441	
  1442	" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'
  1443	
  1444	" 'How far from the body?'
  1445	
  1446	" 'A dozen yards or so.'
  1447	
  1448	" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'
  1449	
  1450	" 'About the same.'
  1451	
  1452	" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'
  1453	
  1454	" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'
  1455	
  1456	"This concluded the examination of the witness."
  1457	
  1458	"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."
  1459	
  1460	Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."
  1461	
  1462	It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.
  1463	
  1464	"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
  1465	
  1466	"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
  1467	
  1468	Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
  1469	
  1470	"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."
  1471	
  1472	Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."
  1473	
  1474	He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
  1475	
  1476	"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
  1477	
  1478	"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
  1479	
  1480	"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"
  1481	
  1482	"I think that it is very probable."
  1483	
  1484	"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
  1485	
  1486	Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
  1487	
  1488	"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."
  1489	
  1490	"In what way?" asked Holmes.
  1491	
  1492	"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
  1493	
  1494	"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"
  1495	
  1496	"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
  1497	
  1498	"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"
  1499	
  1500	"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
  1501	
  1502	"The doctor?"
  1503	
  1504	"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
  1505	
  1506	"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
  1507	
  1508	"Yes, at the mines."
  1509	
  1510	"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."
  1511	
  1512	"Yes, certainly."
  1513	
  1514	"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."
  1515	
  1516	"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."
  1517	
  1518	"I will, Miss Turner."
  1519	
  1520	"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
  1521	
  1522	"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."
  1523	
  1524	"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
  1525	
  1526	"Yes, but only for you and me."
  1527	
  1528	"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
  1529	
  1530	"Ample."
  1531	
  1532	"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
  1533	
  1534	I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.
  1535	
  1536	It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
  1537	
  1538	"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."
  1539	
  1540	"And what did you learn from him?"
  1541	
  1542	"Nothing."
  1543	
  1544	"Could he throw no light?"
  1545	
  1546	"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."
  1547	
  1548	"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."
  1549	
  1550	"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."
  1551	
  1552	"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
  1553	
  1554	"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow."
  1555	
  1556	There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
  1557	
  1558	"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."
  1559	
  1560	"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
  1561	
  1562	"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
  1563	
  1564	"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
  1565	
  1566	"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."
  1567	
  1568	"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"
  1569	
  1570	"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
  1571	
  1572	"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."
  1573	
  1574	"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
  1575	
  1576	"And that is--"
  1577	
  1578	"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
  1579	
  1580	"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."
  1581	
  1582	"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
  1583	
  1584	Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.
  1585	
  1586	The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
  1587	
  1588	"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
  1589	
  1590	"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"
  1591	
  1592	"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
  1593	
  1594	"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."
  1595	
  1596	It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.
  1597	
  1598	"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it."
  1599	
  1600	"I see no marks."
  1601	
  1602	"There are none."
  1603	
  1604	"How do you know, then?"
  1605	
  1606	"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."
  1607	
  1608	"And the murderer?"
  1609	
  1610	"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
  1611	
  1612	Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."
  1613	
  1614	"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
  1615	
  1616	"And leave your case unfinished?"
  1617	
  1618	"No, finished."
  1619	
  1620	"But the mystery?"
  1621	
  1622	"It is solved."
  1623	
  1624	"Who was the criminal, then?"
  1625	
  1626	"The gentleman I describe."
  1627	
  1628	"But who is he?"
  1629	
  1630	"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."
  1631	
  1632	Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
  1633	
  1634	"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."
  1635	
  1636	Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.
  1637	
  1638	"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound."
  1639	
  1640	"Pray do so."
  1641	
  1642	"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
  1643	
  1644	"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
  1645	
  1646	"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia."
  1647	
  1648	"What of the rat, then?"
  1649	
  1650	Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand over part of the map. "What do you read?"
  1651	
  1652	"ARAT," I read.
  1653	
  1654	"And now?" He raised his hand.
  1655	
  1656	"BALLARAT."
  1657	
  1658	"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
  1659	
  1660	"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
  1661	
  1662	"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
  1663	
  1664	"Certainly."
  1665	
  1666	"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."
  1667	
  1668	"Quite so."
  1669	
  1670	"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
  1671	
  1672	"But how did you gain them?"
  1673	
  1674	"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles."
  1675	
  1676	"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
  1677	
  1678	"Yes, they were peculiar boots."
  1679	
  1680	"But his lameness?"
  1681	
  1682	"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."
  1683	
  1684	"But his left-handedness."
  1685	
  1686	"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam."
  1687	
  1688	"And the cigar-holder?"
  1689	
  1690	"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
  1691	
  1692	"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
  1693	
  1694	"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
  1695	
  1696	The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
  1697	
  1698	"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"
  1699	
  1700	"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."
  1701	
  1702	"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
  1703	
  1704	"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
  1705	
  1706	"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about McCarthy."
  1707	
  1708	The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes."
  1709	
  1710	"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
  1711	
  1712	"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."
  1713	
  1714	"It may not come to that," said Holmes.
  1715	
  1716	"What?"
  1717	
  1718	"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
  1719	
  1720	"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
  1721	
  1722	Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
  1723	
  1724	"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
  1725	
  1726	"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
  1727	
  1728	"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
  1729	
  1730	"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
  1731	
  1732	"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
  1733	
  1734	" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'
  1735	
  1736	"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
  1737	
  1738	"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
  1739	
  1740	"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."
  1741	
  1742	"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."
  1743	
  1744	"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
  1745	
  1746	"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."
  1747	
  1748	"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
  1749	
  1750	"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "
  1751	
  1752	James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.
  1753	
  1754	ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
  1755	
  1756	
  1757	When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.
  1758	
  1759	The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
  1760	
  1761	It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
  1762	
  1763	"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
  1764	
  1765	"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."
  1766	
  1767	"A client, then?"
  1768	
  1769	"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
  1770	
  1771	Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
  1772	
  1773	"Come in!" said he.
  1774	
  1775	The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
  1776	
  1777	"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."
  1778	
  1779	"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."
  1780	
  1781	"Yes, from Horsham."
  1782	
  1783	"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."
  1784	
  1785	"I have come for advice."
  1786	
  1787	"That is easily got."
  1788	
  1789	"And help."
  1790	
  1791	"That is not always so easy."
  1792	
  1793	"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
  1794	
  1795	"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
  1796	
  1797	"He said that you could solve anything."
  1798	
  1799	"He said too much."
  1800	
  1801	"That you are never beaten."
  1802	
  1803	"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman."
  1804	
  1805	"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
  1806	
  1807	"It is true that I have been generally successful."
  1808	
  1809	"Then you may be so with me."
  1810	
  1811	"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case."
  1812	
  1813	"It is no ordinary one."
  1814	
  1815	"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal."
  1816	
  1817	"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family."
  1818	
  1819	"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important."
  1820	
  1821	The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.
  1822	
  1823	"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.
  1824	
  1825	"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
  1826	
  1827	"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
  1828	
  1829	"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.
  1830	
  1831	"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
  1832	
  1833	" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
  1834	
  1835	" 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
  1836	
  1837	" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
  1838	
  1839	"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.
  1840	
  1841	" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
  1842	
  1843	"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
  1844	
  1845	"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."
  1846	
  1847	"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."
  1848	
  1849	"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd."
  1850	
  1851	"Thank you. Pray proceed."
  1852	
  1853	"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.
  1854	
  1855	"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.
  1856	
  1857	" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
  1858	
  1859	"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
  1860	
  1861	"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?'
  1862	
  1863	" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.
  1864	
  1865	" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
  1866	
  1867	" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'
  1868	
  1869	" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'
  1870	
  1871	" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
  1872	
  1873	" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.'
  1874	
  1875	" 'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
  1876	
  1877	" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'
  1878	
  1879	" 'Then let me do so?'
  1880	
  1881	" 'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'
  1882	
  1883	"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
  1884	
  1885	"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
  1886	
  1887	"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.
  1888	
  1889	"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."
  1890	
  1891	The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
  1892	
  1893	"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.' "
  1894	
  1895	"What have you done?" asked Holmes.
  1896	
  1897	"Nothing."
  1898	
  1899	"Nothing?"
  1900	
  1901	"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."
  1902	
  1903	"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."
  1904	
  1905	"I have seen the police."
  1906	
  1907	"Ah!"
  1908	
  1909	"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."
  1910	
  1911	Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.
  1912	
  1913	"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."
  1914	
  1915	"Has he come with you to-night?"
  1916	
  1917	"No. His orders were to stay in the house."
  1918	
  1919	Again Holmes raved in the air.
  1920	
  1921	"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"
  1922	
  1923	"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."
  1924	
  1925	"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?"
  1926	
  1927	"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."
  1928	
  1929	Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:
  1930	
  1931	"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
  1932	
  1933	"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
  1934	
  1935	        John Swain, of St. Augustine.
  1936	
  1937	"9th. McCauley cleared.
  1938	
  1939	"10th. John Swain cleared.
  1940	
  1941	"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
  1942	
  1943	"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act."
  1944	
  1945	"What shall I do?"
  1946	
  1947	"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"
  1948	
  1949	"Entirely."
  1950	
  1951	"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."
  1952	
  1953	"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."
  1954	
  1955	"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?"
  1956	
  1957	"By train from Waterloo."
  1958	
  1959	"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."
  1960	
  1961	"I am armed."
  1962	
  1963	"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
  1964	
  1965	"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
  1966	
  1967	"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it."
  1968	
  1969	"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.
  1970	
  1971	Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
  1972	
  1973	"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."
  1974	
  1975	"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
  1976	
  1977	"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos."
  1978	
  1979	"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"
  1980	
  1981	"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
  1982	
  1983	"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"
  1984	
  1985	Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."
  1986	
  1987	"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."
  1988	
  1989	Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"
  1990	
  1991	"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London."
  1992	
  1993	"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
  1994	
  1995	"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
  1996	
  1997	"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"
  1998	
  1999	"A greater distance to travel."
  2000	
  2001	"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
  2002	
  2003	"Then I do not see the point."
  2004	
  2005	"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."
  2006	
  2007	"It is possible."
  2008	
  2009	"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
  2010	
  2011	"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"
  2012	
  2013	"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."
  2014	
  2015	"But of what society?"
  2016	
  2017	"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
  2018	
  2019	"I never have."
  2020	
  2021	Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:
  2022	
  2023	" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
  2024	
  2025	"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
  2026	
  2027	"Then the page we have seen--"
  2028	
  2029	"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men."
  2030	
  2031	It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
  2032	
  2033	"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."
  2034	
  2035	"What steps will you take?" I asked.
  2036	
  2037	"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."
  2038	
  2039	"You will not go there first?"
  2040	
  2041	"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."
  2042	
  2043	As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
  2044	
  2045	"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
  2046	
  2047	"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
  2048	
  2049	"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
  2050	
  2051	" 'Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.' "
  2052	
  2053	We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.
  2054	
  2055	"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
  2056	
  2057	"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
  2058	
  2059	"To the police?"
  2060	
  2061	"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."
  2062	
  2063	All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.
  2064	
  2065	"You are hungry," I remarked.
  2066	
  2067	"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast."
  2068	
  2069	"Nothing?"
  2070	
  2071	"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
  2072	
  2073	"And how have you succeeded?"
  2074	
  2075	"Well."
  2076	
  2077	"You have a clue?"
  2078	
  2079	"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
  2080	
  2081	"What do you mean?"
  2082	
  2083	He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."
  2084	
  2085	"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
  2086	
  2087	"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
  2088	
  2089	"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."
  2090	
  2091	"How did you trace it, then?"
  2092	
  2093	He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.
  2094	
  2095	"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union."
  2096	
  2097	"Texas, I think."
  2098	
  2099	"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."
  2100	
  2101	"What then?"
  2102	
  2103	"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."
  2104	
  2105	"Yes?"
  2106	
  2107	"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
  2108	
  2109	"What will you do, then?"
  2110	
  2111	"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."
  2112	
  2113	There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.
  2114	
  2115	ADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
  2116	
  2117	
  2118	Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
  2119	
  2120	One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
  2121	
  2122	"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
  2123	
  2124	I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
  2125	
  2126	We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
  2127	
  2128	"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
  2129	
  2130	"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."
  2131	
  2132	"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.
  2133	
  2134	"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
  2135	
  2136	"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"
  2137	
  2138	It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
  2139	
  2140	It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
  2141	
  2142	There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.
  2143	
  2144	But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.
  2145	
  2146	Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.
  2147	
  2148	As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
  2149	
  2150	"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
  2151	
  2152	There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.
  2153	
  2154	"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"
  2155	
  2156	"Nearly eleven."
  2157	
  2158	"Of what day?"
  2159	
  2160	"Of Friday, June 19th."
  2161	
  2162	"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
  2163	
  2164	"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
  2165	
  2166	"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
  2167	
  2168	"Yes, I have one waiting."
  2169	
  2170	"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
  2171	
  2172	I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
  2173	
  2174	"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
  2175	
  2176	"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you."
  2177	
  2178	"I have a cab outside."
  2179	
  2180	"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
  2181	
  2182	It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
  2183	
  2184	"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views."
  2185	
  2186	"I was certainly surprised to find you there."
  2187	
  2188	"But not more so than I to find you."
  2189	
  2190	"I came to find a friend."
  2191	
  2192	"And I to find an enemy."
  2193	
  2194	"An enemy?"
  2195	
  2196	"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."
  2197	
  2198	"What! You do not mean bodies?"
  2199	
  2200	"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
  2201	
  2202	"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
  2203	
  2204	"If I can be of use."
  2205	
  2206	"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
  2207	
  2208	"The Cedars?"
  2209	
  2210	"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."
  2211	
  2212	"Where is it, then?"
  2213	
  2214	"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
  2215	
  2216	"But I am all in the dark."
  2217	
  2218	"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!"
  2219	
  2220	He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
  2221	
  2222	"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
  2223	
  2224	"You forget that I know nothing about it."
  2225	
  2226	"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."
  2227	
  2228	"Proceed, then."
  2229	
  2230	"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
  2231	
  2232	"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"
  2233	
  2234	"It is very clear."
  2235	
  2236	"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
  2237	
  2238	"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.
  2239	
  2240	"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.
  2241	
  2242	"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.
  2243	
  2244	"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
  2245	
  2246	"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?"
  2247	
  2248	"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."
  2249	
  2250	"Pray continue your narrative."
  2251	
  2252	"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
  2253	
  2254	"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?"
  2255	
  2256	"I cannot imagine."
  2257	
  2258	"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river."
  2259	
  2260	"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
  2261	
  2262	"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."
  2263	
  2264	"It certainly sounds feasible."
  2265	
  2266	"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
  2267	
  2268	While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
  2269	
  2270	"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
  2271	
  2272	"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.
  2273	
  2274	"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
  2275	
  2276	We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
  2277	
  2278	"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
  2279	
  2280	"No good news?"
  2281	
  2282	"None."
  2283	
  2284	"No bad?"
  2285	
  2286	"No."
  2287	
  2288	"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."
  2289	
  2290	"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation."
  2291	
  2292	"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us."
  2293	
  2294	"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."
  2295	
  2296	"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."
  2297	
  2298	"Certainly, madam."
  2299	
  2300	"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
  2301	
  2302	"Upon what point?"
  2303	
  2304	"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
  2305	
  2306	Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
  2307	
  2308	"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
  2309	
  2310	"You think that he is dead?"
  2311	
  2312	"I do."
  2313	
  2314	"Murdered?"
  2315	
  2316	"I don't say that. Perhaps."
  2317	
  2318	"And on what day did he meet his death?"
  2319	
  2320	"On Monday."
  2321	
  2322	"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
  2323	
  2324	Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
  2325	
  2326	"What!" he roared.
  2327	
  2328	"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.
  2329	
  2330	"May I see it?"
  2331	
  2332	"Certainly."
  2333	
  2334	He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.
  2335	
  2336	"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."
  2337	
  2338	"No, but the enclosure is."
  2339	
  2340	"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."
  2341	
  2342	"How can you tell that?"
  2343	
  2344	"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"
  2345	
  2346	"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
  2347	
  2348	"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"
  2349	
  2350	"One of his hands."
  2351	
  2352	"One?"
  2353	
  2354	"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."
  2355	
  2356	" 'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"
  2357	
  2358	"None. Neville wrote those words."
  2359	
  2360	"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over."
  2361	
  2362	"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
  2363	
  2364	"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him."
  2365	
  2366	"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
  2367	
  2368	"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day."
  2369	
  2370	"That is possible."
  2371	
  2372	"If so, much may have happened between."
  2373	
  2374	"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
  2375	
  2376	"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"
  2377	
  2378	"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
  2379	
  2380	"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"
  2381	
  2382	"No."
  2383	
  2384	"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"
  2385	
  2386	"Very much so."
  2387	
  2388	"Was the window open?"
  2389	
  2390	"Yes."
  2391	
  2392	"Then he might have called to you?"
  2393	
  2394	"He might."
  2395	
  2396	"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"
  2397	
  2398	"Yes."
  2399	
  2400	"A call for help, you thought?"
  2401	
  2402	"Yes. He waved his hands."
  2403	
  2404	"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
  2405	
  2406	"It is possible."
  2407	
  2408	"And you thought he was pulled back?"
  2409	
  2410	"He disappeared so suddenly."
  2411	
  2412	"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?"
  2413	
  2414	"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."
  2415	
  2416	"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"
  2417	
  2418	"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat."
  2419	
  2420	"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
  2421	
  2422	"Never."
  2423	
  2424	"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"
  2425	
  2426	"Never."
  2427	
  2428	"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."
  2429	
  2430	A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
  2431	
  2432	"Awake, Watson?" he asked.
  2433	
  2434	"Yes."
  2435	
  2436	"Game for a morning drive?"
  2437	
  2438	"Certainly."
  2439	
  2440	"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
  2441	
  2442	As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
  2443	
  2444	"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now."
  2445	
  2446	"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
  2447	
  2448	"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."
  2449	
  2450	We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
  2451	
  2452	"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."
  2453	
  2454	In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
  2455	
  2456	"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
  2457	
  2458	"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
  2459	
  2460	"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.
  2461	
  2462	"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
  2463	
  2464	"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."
  2465	
  2466	"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
  2467	
  2468	"So I heard. You have him here?"
  2469	
  2470	"In the cells."
  2471	
  2472	"Is he quiet?"
  2473	
  2474	"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
  2475	
  2476	"Dirty?"
  2477	
  2478	"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
  2479	
  2480	"I should like to see him very much."
  2481	
  2482	"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."
  2483	
  2484	"No, I think that I'll take it."
  2485	
  2486	"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
  2487	
  2488	"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.
  2489	
  2490	"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
  2491	
  2492	We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
  2493	
  2494	"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
  2495	
  2496	"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
  2497	
  2498	"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
  2499	
  2500	"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."
  2501	
  2502	"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.
  2503	
  2504	"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."
  2505	
  2506	Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
  2507	
  2508	"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph."
  2509	
  2510	The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"
  2511	
  2512	"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
  2513	
  2514	"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained."
  2515	
  2516	"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."
  2517	
  2518	"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
  2519	
  2520	Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.
  2521	
  2522	"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."
  2523	
  2524	"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
  2525	
  2526	"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.
  2527	
  2528	"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
  2529	
  2530	"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
  2531	
  2532	"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.
  2533	
  2534	"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.
  2535	
  2536	"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
  2537	
  2538	"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."
  2539	
  2540	"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
  2541	
  2542	"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
  2543	
  2544	"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
  2545	
  2546	"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
  2547	
  2548	"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
  2549	
  2550	"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
  2551	
  2552	"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
  2553	
  2554	"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."
  2555	
  2556	"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
  2557	
  2558	VII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
  2559	
  2560	
  2561	I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.
  2562	
  2563	"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
  2564	
  2565	"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."
  2566	
  2567	I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
  2568	
  2569	"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such."
  2570	
  2571	"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."
  2572	
  2573	"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
  2574	
  2575	"Yes."
  2576	
  2577	"It is to him that this trophy belongs."
  2578	
  2579	"It is his hat."
  2580	
  2581	"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
  2582	
  2583	"Which surely he restored to their owner?"
  2584	
  2585	"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them."
  2586	
  2587	"What, then, did Peterson do?"
  2588	
  2589	"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."
  2590	
  2591	"Did he not advertise?"
  2592	
  2593	"No."
  2594	
  2595	"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
  2596	
  2597	"Only as much as we can deduce."
  2598	
  2599	"From his hat?"
  2600	
  2601	"Precisely."
  2602	
  2603	"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"
  2604	
  2605	"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"
  2606	
  2607	I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
  2608	
  2609	"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
  2610	
  2611	"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."
  2612	
  2613	"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
  2614	
  2615	He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."
  2616	
  2617	"My dear Holmes!"
  2618	
  2619	"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."
  2620	
  2621	"You are certainly joking, Holmes."
  2622	
  2623	"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
  2624	
  2625	"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"
  2626	
  2627	For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."
  2628	
  2629	"The decline of his fortunes, then?"
  2630	
  2631	"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
  2632	
  2633	"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"
  2634	
  2635	Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."
  2636	
  2637	"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
  2638	
  2639	"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."
  2640	
  2641	"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
  2642	
  2643	"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."
  2644	
  2645	"But he might be a bachelor."
  2646	
  2647	"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
  2648	
  2649	"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"
  2650	
  2651	"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
  2652	
  2653	"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."
  2654	
  2655	Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
  2656	
  2657	"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
  2658	
  2659	"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
  2660	
  2661	"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.
  2662	
  2663	Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?"
  2664	
  2665	"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."
  2666	
  2667	"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
  2668	
  2669	"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
  2670	
  2671	"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."
  2672	
  2673	"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
  2674	
  2675	"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."
  2676	
  2677	"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.
  2678	
  2679	"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
  2680	
  2681	"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."
  2682	
  2683	"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
  2684	
  2685	"What will you say?"
  2686	
  2687	"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
  2688	
  2689	"Very. But will he see it?"
  2690	
  2691	"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."
  2692	
  2693	"In which, sir?"
  2694	
  2695	"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
  2696	
  2697	"Very well, sir. And this stone?"
  2698	
  2699	"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."
  2700	
  2701	When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
  2702	
  2703	"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
  2704	
  2705	"I cannot tell."
  2706	
  2707	"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?"
  2708	
  2709	"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
  2710	
  2711	"And you can do nothing until then?"
  2712	
  2713	"Nothing."
  2714	
  2715	"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
  2716	
  2717	"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
  2718	
  2719	I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.
  2720	
  2721	"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
  2722	
  2723	"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
  2724	
  2725	He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
  2726	
  2727	"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
  2728	
  2729	Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."
  2730	
  2731	"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."
  2732	
  2733	"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
  2734	
  2735	"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"
  2736	
  2737	"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.
  2738	
  2739	"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"
  2740	
  2741	The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."
  2742	
  2743	Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
  2744	
  2745	"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."
  2746	
  2747	"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.
  2748	
  2749	"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
  2750	
  2751	"Not particularly."
  2752	
  2753	"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."
  2754	
  2755	"By all means."
  2756	
  2757	It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
  2758	
  2759	"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.
  2760	
  2761	"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
  2762	
  2763	"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."
  2764	
  2765	"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
  2766	
  2767	"Indeed! Whose, then?"
  2768	
  2769	"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
  2770	
  2771	"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
  2772	
  2773	"Breckinridge is his name."
  2774	
  2775	"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night."
  2776	
  2777	"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!"
  2778	
  2779	We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.
  2780	
  2781	"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
  2782	
  2783	The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
  2784	
  2785	"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.
  2786	
  2787	"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
  2788	
  2789	"That's no good."
  2790	
  2791	"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
  2792	
  2793	"Ah, but I was recommended to you."
  2794	
  2795	"Who by?"
  2796	
  2797	"The landlord of the Alpha."
  2798	
  2799	"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
  2800	
  2801	"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
  2802	
  2803	To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.
  2804	
  2805	"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
  2806	
  2807	"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha."
  2808	
  2809	"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
  2810	
  2811	"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle."
  2812	
  2813	"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them."
  2814	
  2815	"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."
  2816	
  2817	"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman.
  2818	
  2819	"It's nothing of the kind."
  2820	
  2821	"I say it is."
  2822	
  2823	"I don't believe it."
  2824	
  2825	"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred."
  2826	
  2827	"You'll never persuade me to believe that."
  2828	
  2829	"Will you bet, then?"
  2830	
  2831	"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."
  2832	
  2833	The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.
  2834	
  2835	The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
  2836	
  2837	"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
  2838	
  2839	"Well?"
  2840	
  2841	"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me."
  2842	
  2843	"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
  2844	
  2845	"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
  2846	
  2847	Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' "
  2848	
  2849	"Now, then, what's the last entry?"
  2850	
  2851	" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "
  2852	
  2853	"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"
  2854	
  2855	" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' "
  2856	
  2857	"What have you to say now?"
  2858	
  2859	Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.
  2860	
  2861	"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
  2862	
  2863	His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
  2864	
  2865	"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"
  2866	
  2867	"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.
  2868	
  2869	"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
  2870	
  2871	"She told me to ask you."
  2872	
  2873	"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
  2874	
  2875	"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
  2876	
  2877	"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.
  2878	
  2879	"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you."
  2880	
  2881	"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
  2882	
  2883	"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."
  2884	
  2885	"But you can know nothing of this?"
  2886	
  2887	"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member."
  2888	
  2889	"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
  2890	
  2891	Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
  2892	
  2893	The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.
  2894	
  2895	"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."
  2896	
  2897	A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."
  2898	
  2899	"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."
  2900	
  2901	The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
  2902	
  2903	"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?"
  2904	
  2905	"Yes, sir."
  2906	
  2907	"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail."
  2908	
  2909	Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"
  2910	
  2911	"It came here."
  2912	
  2913	"Here?"
  2914	
  2915	"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum."
  2916	
  2917	Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
  2918	
  2919	"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
  2920	
  2921	For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.
  2922	
  2923	"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"
  2924	
  2925	"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.
  2926	
  2927	"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"
  2928	
  2929	Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"
  2930	
  2931	"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
  2932	
  2933	"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down."
  2934	
  2935	"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."
  2936	
  2937	Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.
  2938	
  2939	"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.
  2940	
  2941	"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.
  2942	
  2943	" 'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
  2944	
  2945	" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.'
  2946	
  2947	" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'
  2948	
  2949	" 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
  2950	
  2951	" 'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'
  2952	
  2953	" 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
  2954	
  2955	" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?'
  2956	
  2957	" 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'
  2958	
  2959	" 'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
  2960	
  2961	"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
  2962	
  2963	" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.
  2964	
  2965	" 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
  2966	
  2967	" 'Which dealer's?'
  2968	
  2969	" 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
  2970	
  2971	" 'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'
  2972	
  2973	" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'
  2974	
  2975	"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
  2976	
  2977	There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
  2978	
  2979	"Get out!" said he.
  2980	
  2981	"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
  2982	
  2983	"No more words. Get out!"
  2984	
  2985	And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.
  2986	
  2987	"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature."
  2988	
  2989	VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
  2990	
  2991	
  2992	On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.
  2993	
  2994	It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
  2995	
  2996	"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."
  2997	
  2998	"What is it, then--a fire?"
  2999	
  3000	"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."
  3001	
  3002	"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
  3003	
  3004	I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
  3005	
  3006	"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
  3007	
  3008	"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.
  3009	
  3010	"What, then?"
  3011	
  3012	"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.
  3013	
  3014	"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
  3015	
  3016	"You know me, then?"
  3017	
  3018	"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."
  3019	
  3020	The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.
  3021	
  3022	"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
  3023	
  3024	"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."
  3025	
  3026	Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.
  3027	
  3028	"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."
  3029	
  3030	"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."
  3031	
  3032	"I am all attention, madam."
  3033	
  3034	"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."
  3035	
  3036	Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
  3037	
  3038	"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
  3039	
  3040	"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
  3041	
  3042	"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
  3043	
  3044	"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.
  3045	
  3046	"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."
  3047	
  3048	"Your sister is dead, then?"
  3049	
  3050	"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
  3051	
  3052	Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
  3053	
  3054	"Pray be precise as to details," said he.
  3055	
  3056	"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
  3057	
  3058	"Perfectly so."
  3059	
  3060	"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
  3061	
  3062	" 'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'
  3063	
  3064	" 'Never,' said I.
  3065	
  3066	" 'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'
  3067	
  3068	" 'Certainly not. But why?'
  3069	
  3070	" 'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'
  3071	
  3072	" 'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'
  3073	
  3074	" 'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'
  3075	
  3076	" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'
  3077	
  3078	" 'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."
  3079	
  3080	"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"
  3081	
  3082	"Always."
  3083	
  3084	"And why?"
  3085	
  3086	"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."
  3087	
  3088	"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
  3089	
  3090	"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
  3091	
  3092	"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
  3093	
  3094	"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."
  3095	
  3096	"Was your sister dressed?"
  3097	
  3098	"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
  3099	
  3100	"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"
  3101	
  3102	"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
  3103	
  3104	"How about poison?"
  3105	
  3106	"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
  3107	
  3108	"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
  3109	
  3110	"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
  3111	
  3112	"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"
  3113	
  3114	"Yes, there are nearly always some there."
  3115	
  3116	"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"
  3117	
  3118	"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
  3119	
  3120	Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
  3121	
  3122	"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative."
  3123	
  3124	"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."
  3125	
  3126	"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me all?"
  3127	
  3128	"Yes, all."
  3129	
  3130	"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
  3131	
  3132	"Why, what do you mean?"
  3133	
  3134	For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
  3135	
  3136	"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
  3137	
  3138	The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."
  3139	
  3140	There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
  3141	
  3142	"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"
  3143	
  3144	"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."
  3145	
  3146	"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
  3147	
  3148	"By no means."
  3149	
  3150	"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
  3151	
  3152	"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."
  3153	
  3154	"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"
  3155	
  3156	"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.
  3157	
  3158	"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.
  3159	
  3160	"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
  3161	
  3162	"Dark enough and sinister enough."
  3163	
  3164	"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."
  3165	
  3166	"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
  3167	
  3168	"I cannot think."
  3169	
  3170	"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
  3171	
  3172	"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
  3173	
  3174	"I cannot imagine."
  3175	
  3176	"I see many objections to any such theory."
  3177	
  3178	"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!"
  3179	
  3180	The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.
  3181	
  3182	"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
  3183	
  3184	"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.
  3185	
  3186	"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
  3187	
  3188	"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
  3189	
  3190	"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
  3191	
  3192	"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
  3193	
  3194	"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.
  3195	
  3196	"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.
  3197	
  3198	"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
  3199	
  3200	My friend smiled.
  3201	
  3202	"Holmes, the busybody!"
  3203	
  3204	His smile broadened.
  3205	
  3206	"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
  3207	
  3208	Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."
  3209	
  3210	"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
  3211	
  3212	"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.
  3213	
  3214	"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
  3215	
  3216	"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."
  3217	
  3218	It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.
  3219	
  3220	"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."
  3221	
  3222	At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
  3223	
  3224	"Look there!" said he.
  3225	
  3226	A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
  3227	
  3228	"Stoke Moran?" said he.
  3229	
  3230	"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.
  3231	
  3232	"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."
  3233	
  3234	"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."
  3235	
  3236	"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
  3237	
  3238	We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
  3239	
  3240	"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."
  3241	
  3242	Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."
  3243	
  3244	"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
  3245	
  3246	"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
  3247	
  3248	"So it appears."
  3249	
  3250	"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"
  3251	
  3252	"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."
  3253	
  3254	The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
  3255	
  3256	"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
  3257	
  3258	"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
  3259	
  3260	"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."
  3261	
  3262	"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."
  3263	
  3264	"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"
  3265	
  3266	"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."
  3267	
  3268	"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
  3269	
  3270	Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."
  3271	
  3272	A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.
  3273	
  3274	"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
  3275	
  3276	"It goes to the housekeeper's room."
  3277	
  3278	"It looks newer than the other things?"
  3279	
  3280	"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
  3281	
  3282	"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
  3283	
  3284	"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."
  3285	
  3286	"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
  3287	
  3288	"Why, it's a dummy," said he.
  3289	
  3290	"Won't it ring?"
  3291	
  3292	"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."
  3293	
  3294	"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
  3295	
  3296	"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"
  3297	
  3298	"That is also quite modern," said the lady.
  3299	
  3300	"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
  3301	
  3302	"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."
  3303	
  3304	"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."
  3305	
  3306	Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.
  3307	
  3308	"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
  3309	
  3310	"My stepfather's business papers."
  3311	
  3312	"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
  3313	
  3314	"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."
  3315	
  3316	"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
  3317	
  3318	"No. What a strange idea!"
  3319	
  3320	"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.
  3321	
  3322	"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
  3323	
  3324	"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.
  3325	
  3326	"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
  3327	
  3328	The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
  3329	
  3330	"What do you make of that, Watson?"
  3331	
  3332	"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."
  3333	
  3334	"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
  3335	
  3336	I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.
  3337	
  3338	"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."
  3339	
  3340	"I shall most certainly do so."
  3341	
  3342	"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."
  3343	
  3344	"I assure you that I am in your hands."
  3345	
  3346	"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."
  3347	
  3348	Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
  3349	
  3350	"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"
  3351	
  3352	"Yes, that is the Crown."
  3353	
  3354	"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
  3355	
  3356	"Certainly."
  3357	
  3358	"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
  3359	
  3360	"Oh, yes, easily."
  3361	
  3362	"The rest you will leave in our hands."
  3363	
  3364	"But what will you do?"
  3365	
  3366	"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
  3367	
  3368	"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
  3369	
  3370	"Perhaps I have."
  3371	
  3372	"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."
  3373	
  3374	"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
  3375	
  3376	"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."
  3377	
  3378	"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."
  3379	
  3380	Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
  3381	
  3382	"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
  3383	
  3384	"Can I be of assistance?"
  3385	
  3386	"Your presence might be invaluable."
  3387	
  3388	"Then I shall certainly come."
  3389	
  3390	"It is very kind of you."
  3391	
  3392	"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."
  3393	
  3394	"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."
  3395	
  3396	"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
  3397	
  3398	"You saw the ventilator, too?"
  3399	
  3400	"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."
  3401	
  3402	"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."
  3403	
  3404	"My dear Holmes!"
  3405	
  3406	"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
  3407	
  3408	"But what harm can there be in that?"
  3409	
  3410	"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
  3411	
  3412	"I cannot as yet see any connection."
  3413	
  3414	"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
  3415	
  3416	"No."
  3417	
  3418	"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"
  3419	
  3420	"I cannot say that I have."
  3421	
  3422	"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
  3423	
  3424	"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."
  3425	
  3426	"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."
  3427	
  3428	About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
  3429	
  3430	"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."
  3431	
  3432	As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
  3433	
  3434	There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
  3435	
  3436	"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
  3437	
  3438	Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.
  3439	
  3440	"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
  3441	
  3442	I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:
  3443	
  3444	"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
  3445	
  3446	I nodded to show that I had heard.
  3447	
  3448	"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator."
  3449	
  3450	I nodded again.
  3451	
  3452	"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."
  3453	
  3454	I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
  3455	
  3456	Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
  3457	
  3458	How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
  3459	
  3460	From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.
  3461	
  3462	Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
  3463	
  3464	"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
  3465	
  3466	But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
  3467	
  3468	"What can it mean?" I gasped.
  3469	
  3470	"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."
  3471	
  3472	With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
  3473	
  3474	It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
  3475	
  3476	"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
  3477	
  3478	I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
  3479	
  3480	"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."
  3481	
  3482	As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
  3483	
  3484	Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.
  3485	
  3486	"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
  3487	
  3488	"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."
  3489	
  3490	"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
  3491	
  3492	"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
  3493	
  3494	IX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
  3495	
  3496	
  3497	Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
  3498	
  3499	It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
  3500	
  3501	One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
  3502	
  3503	"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."
  3504	
  3505	"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
  3506	
  3507	"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
  3508	
  3509	I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.
  3510	
  3511	"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table."
  3512	
  3513	I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."
  3514	
  3515	"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.
  3516	
  3517	"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.
  3518	
  3519	It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.
  3520	
  3521	"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
  3522	
  3523	"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
  3524	
  3525	"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be."
  3526	
  3527	He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
  3528	
  3529	"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."
  3530	
  3531	"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
  3532	
  3533	"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
  3534	
  3535	"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."
  3536	
  3537	"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument."
  3538	
  3539	"A thing like a cleaver," said he.
  3540	
  3541	"An accident, I presume?"
  3542	
  3543	"By no means."
  3544	
  3545	"What! a murderous attack?"
  3546	
  3547	"Very murderous indeed."
  3548	
  3549	"You horrify me."
  3550	
  3551	I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
  3552	
  3553	"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
  3554	
  3555	"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
  3556	
  3557	"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."
  3558	
  3559	"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
  3560	
  3561	"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police."
  3562	
  3563	"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"
  3564	
  3565	"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
  3566	
  3567	"I should be immensely obliged to you."
  3568	
  3569	"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"
  3570	
  3571	"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
  3572	
  3573	"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.
  3574	
  3575	Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.
  3576	
  3577	"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
  3578	
  3579	"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."
  3580	
  3581	Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.
  3582	
  3583	"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.
  3584	
  3585	"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.
  3586	
  3587	"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.
  3588	
  3589	" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent. 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'
  3590	
  3591	"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
  3592	
  3593	" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
  3594	
  3595	" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'
  3596	
  3597	" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
  3598	
  3599	" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'
  3600	
  3601	"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
  3602	
  3603	" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
  3604	
  3605	" 'Yes, I promise.'
  3606	
  3607	" 'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
  3608	
  3609	" 'I have already given you my word.'
  3610	
  3611	" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.
  3612	
  3613	" 'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
  3614	
  3615	"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
  3616	
  3617	" 'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.
  3618	
  3619	" 'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.
  3620	
  3621	" 'Most admirably.'
  3622	
  3623	" 'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?'
  3624	
  3625	" 'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
  3626	
  3627	" 'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'
  3628	
  3629	" 'Where to?'
  3630	
  3631	" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'
  3632	
  3633	" 'Very good.'
  3634	
  3635	" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
  3636	
  3637	" 'There is a drive, then?'
  3638	
  3639	" 'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'
  3640	
  3641	" 'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.'
  3642	
  3643	" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
  3644	
  3645	" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'
  3646	
  3647	" 'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'
  3648	
  3649	"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'
  3650	
  3651	" 'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'
  3652	
  3653	" 'Entirely.'
  3654	
  3655	" 'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?'
  3656	
  3657	" 'I have heard so.'
  3658	
  3659	" 'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
  3660	
  3661	" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'
  3662	
  3663	" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'
  3664	
  3665	" 'I shall certainly be there.'
  3666	
  3667	" 'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.
  3668	
  3669	"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
  3670	
  3671	"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."
  3672	
  3673	"One horse?" interjected Holmes.
  3674	
  3675	"Yes, only one."
  3676	
  3677	"Did you observe the colour?"
  3678	
  3679	"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut."
  3680	
  3681	"Tired-looking or fresh?"
  3682	
  3683	"Oh, fresh and glossy."
  3684	
  3685	"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement."
  3686	
  3687	"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
  3688	
  3689	"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
  3690	
  3691	" 'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the darkness.
  3692	
  3693	"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
  3694	
  3695	"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
  3696	
  3697	" 'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.'
  3698	
  3699	" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
  3700	
  3701	" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'
  3702	
  3703	"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
  3704	
  3705	"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
  3706	
  3707	" 'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
  3708	
  3709	" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.'
  3710	
  3711	"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'
  3712	
  3713	" 'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
  3714	
  3715	" 'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
  3716	
  3717	" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
  3718	
  3719	" 'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.'
  3720	
  3721	"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.
  3722	
  3723	"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.
  3724	
  3725	" 'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.'
  3726	
  3727	"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.
  3728	
  3729	" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.
  3730	
  3731	"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'
  3732	
  3733	"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.
  3734	
  3735	" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
  3736	
  3737	"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
  3738	
  3739	"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.
  3740	
  3741	"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
  3742	
  3743	" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'
  3744	
  3745	"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
  3746	
  3747	" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'
  3748	
  3749	"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
  3750	
  3751	" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
  3752	
  3753	" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
  3754	
  3755	"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.
  3756	
  3757	"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
  3758	
  3759	"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.
  3760	
  3761	"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."
  3762	
  3763	We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.
  3764	
  3765	"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
  3766	
  3767	"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the girl said."
  3768	
  3769	"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."
  3770	
  3771	Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.
  3772	
  3773	"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
  3774	
  3775	"It was an hour's good drive."
  3776	
  3777	"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"
  3778	
  3779	"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
  3780	
  3781	"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
  3782	
  3783	"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."
  3784	
  3785	"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
  3786	
  3787	"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
  3788	
  3789	"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there."
  3790	
  3791	"And I say east," said my patient.
  3792	
  3793	"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet little villages up there."
  3794	
  3795	"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any."
  3796	
  3797	"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"
  3798	
  3799	"You are all wrong."
  3800	
  3801	"But we can't all be."
  3802	
  3803	"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
  3804	
  3805	"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
  3806	
  3807	"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
  3808	
  3809	"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."
  3810	
  3811	"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."
  3812	
  3813	"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
  3814	
  3815	But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
  3816	
  3817	"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.
  3818	
  3819	"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
  3820	
  3821	"When did it break out?"
  3822	
  3823	"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."
  3824	
  3825	"Whose house is it?"
  3826	
  3827	"Dr. Becher's."
  3828	
  3829	"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
  3830	
  3831	The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
  3832	
  3833	The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
  3834	
  3835	"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."
  3836	
  3837	"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."
  3838	
  3839	And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
  3840	
  3841	The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.
  3842	
  3843	How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
  3844	
  3845	"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?"
  3846	
  3847	"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."
  3848	
  3849	X.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
  3850	
  3851	
  3852	The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.
  3853	
  3854	It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.
  3855	
  3856	"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
  3857	
  3858	"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
  3859	
  3860	He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
  3861	
  3862	"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
  3863	
  3864	"Not social, then?"
  3865	
  3866	"No, distinctly professional."
  3867	
  3868	"And from a noble client?"
  3869	
  3870	"One of the highest in England."
  3871	
  3872	"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
  3873	
  3874	"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"
  3875	
  3876	"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
  3877	
  3878	"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"
  3879	
  3880	"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
  3881	
  3882	"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:
  3883	
  3884	" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,
  3885	
  3886	
  3887	" 'ST. SIMON.'
  3888	
  3889	"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.
  3890	
  3891	"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."
  3892	
  3893	"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."
  3894	
  3895	"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."
  3896	
  3897	"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."
  3898	
  3899	"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
  3900	
  3901	"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.
  3902	
  3903	"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' "
  3904	
  3905	"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
  3906	
  3907	"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
  3908	
  3909	"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
  3910	
  3911	"The vanishing of the lady."
  3912	
  3913	"When did she vanish, then?"
  3914	
  3915	"At the wedding breakfast."
  3916	
  3917	"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."
  3918	
  3919	"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
  3920	
  3921	"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."
  3922	
  3923	"I warn you that they are very incomplete."
  3924	
  3925	"Perhaps we may make them less so."
  3926	
  3927	"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
  3928	
  3929	" 'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
  3930	
  3931	" 'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "
  3932	
  3933	"And is that all?"
  3934	
  3935	"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."
  3936	
  3937	"And it is--"
  3938	
  3939	"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."
  3940	
  3941	"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."
  3942	
  3943	"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.
  3944	
  3945	"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over."
  3946	
  3947	"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society."
  3948	
  3949	"No, I am descending."
  3950	
  3951	"I beg pardon."
  3952	
  3953	"My last client of the sort was a king."
  3954	
  3955	"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
  3956	
  3957	"The King of Scandinavia."
  3958	
  3959	"What! Had he lost his wife?"
  3960	
  3961	"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours."
  3962	
  3963	"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."
  3964	
  3965	"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
  3966	
  3967	Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."
  3968	
  3969	"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."
  3970	
  3971	"Pray do so."
  3972	
  3973	"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
  3974	
  3975	"In San Francisco, a year ago."
  3976	
  3977	"You were travelling in the States?"
  3978	
  3979	"Yes."
  3980	
  3981	"Did you become engaged then?"
  3982	
  3983	"No."
  3984	
  3985	"But you were on a friendly footing?"
  3986	
  3987	"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused."
  3988	
  3989	"Her father is very rich?"
  3990	
  3991	"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
  3992	
  3993	"And how did he make his money?"
  3994	
  3995	"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
  3996	
  3997	"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"
  3998	
  3999	The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
  4000	
  4001	"Have you her photograph?"
  4002	
  4003	"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
  4004	
  4005	"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"
  4006	
  4007	"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."
  4008	
  4009	"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
  4010	
  4011	"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
  4012	
  4013	"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"
  4014	
  4015	"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
  4016	
  4017	"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?"
  4018	
  4019	"Yes."
  4020	
  4021	"Was she in good spirits?"
  4022	
  4023	"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives."
  4024	
  4025	"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?"
  4026	
  4027	"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."
  4028	
  4029	"And did you observe any change in her then?"
  4030	
  4031	"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case."
  4032	
  4033	"Pray let us have it, for all that."
  4034	
  4035	"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
  4036	
  4037	"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?"
  4038	
  4039	"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."
  4040	
  4041	"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
  4042	
  4043	"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
  4044	
  4045	"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"
  4046	
  4047	"I saw her in conversation with her maid."
  4048	
  4049	"And who is her maid?"
  4050	
  4051	"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her."
  4052	
  4053	"A confidential servant?"
  4054	
  4055	"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."
  4056	
  4057	"How long did she speak to this Alice?"
  4058	
  4059	"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
  4060	
  4061	"You did not overhear what they said?"
  4062	
  4063	"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant."
  4064	
  4065	"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
  4066	
  4067	"She walked into the breakfast-room."
  4068	
  4069	"On your arm?"
  4070	
  4071	"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back."
  4072	
  4073	"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."
  4074	
  4075	"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."
  4076	
  4077	"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her."
  4078	
  4079	Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."
  4080	
  4081	"Did your wife hear all this?"
  4082	
  4083	"No, thank goodness, she did not."
  4084	
  4085	"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
  4086	
  4087	"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."
  4088	
  4089	"Well, it is a possible supposition."
  4090	
  4091	"You think so, too?"
  4092	
  4093	"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"
  4094	
  4095	"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
  4096	
  4097	"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"
  4098	
  4099	"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."
  4100	
  4101	"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
  4102	
  4103	"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
  4104	
  4105	"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
  4106	
  4107	"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
  4108	
  4109	"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you."
  4110	
  4111	"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.
  4112	
  4113	"I have solved it."
  4114	
  4115	"Eh? What was that?"
  4116	
  4117	"I say that I have solved it."
  4118	
  4119	"Where, then, is my wife?"
  4120	
  4121	"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
  4122	
  4123	Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
  4124	
  4125	"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."
  4126	
  4127	"My dear Holmes!"
  4128	
  4129	"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
  4130	
  4131	"But I have heard all that you have heard."
  4132	
  4133	"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."
  4134	
  4135	The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
  4136	
  4137	"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."
  4138	
  4139	"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
  4140	
  4141	"Really! You surprise me."
  4142	
  4143	"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
  4144	
  4145	"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
  4146	
  4147	"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
  4148	
  4149	"In heaven's name, what for?"
  4150	
  4151	"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
  4152	
  4153	Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
  4154	
  4155	"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked.
  4156	
  4157	"Why? What do you mean?"
  4158	
  4159	"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."
  4160	
  4161	Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled.
  4162	
  4163	"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
  4164	
  4165	"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?"
  4166	
  4167	"I think it very unlikely."
  4168	
  4169	"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."
  4170	
  4171	"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
  4172	
  4173	"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
  4174	
  4175	"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"
  4176	
  4177	"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
  4178	
  4179	"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
  4180	
  4181	"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
  4182	
  4183	"And how?"
  4184	
  4185	"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."
  4186	
  4187	"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.
  4188	
  4189	"Ha! you find it so?"
  4190	
  4191	"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
  4192	
  4193	Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
  4194	
  4195	"On the contrary, this is the right side."
  4196	
  4197	"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."
  4198	
  4199	"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."
  4200	
  4201	"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
  4202	
  4203	"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again."
  4204	
  4205	"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.
  4206	
  4207	"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person."
  4208	
  4209	Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
  4210	
  4211	He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."
  4212	
  4213	It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.
  4214	
  4215	Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
  4216	
  4217	"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
  4218	
  4219	"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
  4220	
  4221	"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
  4222	
  4223	It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
  4224	
  4225	"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
  4226	
  4227	"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?"
  4228	
  4229	"The best possible."
  4230	
  4231	Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
  4232	
  4233	"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
  4234	
  4235	"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."
  4236	
  4237	"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
  4238	
  4239	"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
  4240	
  4241	"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.
  4242	
  4243	"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."
  4244	
  4245	"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."
  4246	
  4247	"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met."
  4248	
  4249	At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
  4250	
  4251	"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be."
  4252	
  4253	"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
  4254	
  4255	"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
  4256	
  4257	"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?"
  4258	
  4259	"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
  4260	
  4261	"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
  4262	
  4263	"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
  4264	
  4265	"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
  4266	
  4267	"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."
  4268	
  4269	"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived."
  4270	
  4271	"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me."
  4272	
  4273	Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.
  4274	
  4275	"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."
  4276	
  4277	"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
  4278	
  4279	"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
  4280	
  4281	"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."
  4282	
  4283	"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
  4284	
  4285	"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
  4286	
  4287	"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
  4288	
  4289	"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
  4290	
  4291	"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
  4292	
  4293	"And how in the world did you find them?"
  4294	
  4295	"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
  4296	
  4297	"How did you deduce the select?"
  4298	
  4299	"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."
  4300	
  4301	"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."
  4302	
  4303	"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."
  4304	
  4305	XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
  4306	
  4307	
  4308	"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
  4309	
  4310	My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
  4311	
  4312	He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.
  4313	
  4314	"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses."
  4315	
  4316	"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
  4317	
  4318	"Here?"
  4319	
  4320	"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
  4321	
  4322	A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
  4323	
  4324	"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."
  4325	
  4326	The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
  4327	
  4328	"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
  4329	
  4330	"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
  4331	
  4332	"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair."
  4333	
  4334	"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you."
  4335	
  4336	"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
  4337	
  4338	The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
  4339	
  4340	"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
  4341	
  4342	"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
  4343	
  4344	"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
  4345	
  4346	" 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'
  4347	
  4348	" 'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
  4349	
  4350	" 'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'
  4351	
  4352	" 'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
  4353	
  4354	" 'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'
  4355	
  4356	" 'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'
  4357	
  4358	" 'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
  4359	
  4360	" 'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.
  4361	
  4362	" 'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'
  4363	
  4364	"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
  4365	
  4366	" 'You doubt its value?' he asked.
  4367	
  4368	" 'Not at all. I only doubt--'
  4369	
  4370	" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
  4371	
  4372	" 'Ample.'
  4373	
  4374	" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'
  4375	
  4376	"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.
  4377	
  4378	"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
  4379	
  4380	"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
  4381	
  4382	"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.
  4383	
  4384	"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
  4385	
  4386	"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.
  4387	
  4388	"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!
  4389	
  4390	"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.
  4391	
  4392	"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
  4393	
  4394	" 'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.
  4395	
  4396	" 'In my own bureau.'
  4397	
  4398	" 'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.
  4399	
  4400	" 'It is locked up,' I answered.
  4401	
  4402	" 'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'
  4403	
  4404	"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.
  4405	
  4406	" 'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200?'
  4407	
  4408	" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.'
  4409	
  4410	" 'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'
  4411	
  4412	" 'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
  4413	
  4414	" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.'
  4415	
  4416	"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
  4417	
  4418	"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.
  4419	
  4420	" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'
  4421	
  4422	" 'Certainly not.'
  4423	
  4424	" 'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
  4425	
  4426	" 'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
  4427	
  4428	" 'Quite sure, dad.'
  4429	
  4430	" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.
  4431	
  4432	"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."
  4433	
  4434	"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
  4435	
  4436	"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
  4437	
  4438	" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'
  4439	
  4440	"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
  4441	
  4442	" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'
  4443	
  4444	" 'Stolen!' he cried.
  4445	
  4446	" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
  4447	
  4448	" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
  4449	
  4450	" 'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'
  4451	
  4452	" 'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.'
  4453	
  4454	" 'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.'
  4455	
  4456	" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'
  4457	
  4458	"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
  4459	
  4460	" 'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'
  4461	
  4462	" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.
  4463	
  4464	" 'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
  4465	
  4466	" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
  4467	
  4468	He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
  4469	
  4470	Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
  4471	
  4472	"Do you receive much company?" he asked.
  4473	
  4474	"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think."
  4475	
  4476	"Do you go out much in society?"
  4477	
  4478	"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it."
  4479	
  4480	"That is unusual in a young girl."
  4481	
  4482	"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty."
  4483	
  4484	"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also."
  4485	
  4486	"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
  4487	
  4488	"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
  4489	
  4490	"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."
  4491	
  4492	"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?"
  4493	
  4494	"Yes, it was twisted."
  4495	
  4496	"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"
  4497	
  4498	"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
  4499	
  4500	"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
  4501	
  4502	"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."
  4503	
  4504	"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"
  4505	
  4506	"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."
  4507	
  4508	"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
  4509	
  4510	"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."
  4511	
  4512	"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
  4513	
  4514	"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"
  4515	
  4516	"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."
  4517	
  4518	My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.
  4519	
  4520	Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
  4521	
  4522	"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.
  4523	
  4524	"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
  4525	
  4526	"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."
  4527	
  4528	"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
  4529	
  4530	"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."
  4531	
  4532	"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"
  4533	
  4534	"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"
  4535	
  4536	"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
  4537	
  4538	"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
  4539	
  4540	"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."
  4541	
  4542	"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
  4543	
  4544	"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
  4545	
  4546	"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
  4547	
  4548	"You heard nothing yourself last night?"
  4549	
  4550	"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down."
  4551	
  4552	"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?"
  4553	
  4554	"Yes."
  4555	
  4556	"Were they all fastened this morning?"
  4557	
  4558	"Yes."
  4559	
  4560	"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
  4561	
  4562	"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
  4563	
  4564	"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
  4565	
  4566	"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"
  4567	
  4568	"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?"
  4569	
  4570	"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
  4571	
  4572	"Do you know him?"
  4573	
  4574	"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."
  4575	
  4576	"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
  4577	
  4578	"Yes, he did."
  4579	
  4580	"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
  4581	
  4582	Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.
  4583	
  4584	"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
  4585	
  4586	He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.
  4587	
  4588	The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
  4589	
  4590	"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
  4591	
  4592	"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."
  4593	
  4594	"Have you it here?"
  4595	
  4596	"That is it on the dressing-table."
  4597	
  4598	Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
  4599	
  4600	"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
  4601	
  4602	"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."
  4603	
  4604	The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.
  4605	
  4606	"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"
  4607	
  4608	"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
  4609	
  4610	"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?"
  4611	
  4612	"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
  4613	
  4614	"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
  4615	
  4616	"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
  4617	
  4618	"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."
  4619	
  4620	He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
  4621	
  4622	"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."
  4623	
  4624	"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
  4625	
  4626	"I cannot tell."
  4627	
  4628	The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
  4629	
  4630	"My opinion is in no way altered."
  4631	
  4632	"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"
  4633	
  4634	"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."
  4635	
  4636	"I would give my fortune to have them back."
  4637	
  4638	"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening."
  4639	
  4640	It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
  4641	
  4642	"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
  4643	
  4644	I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
  4645	
  4646	"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
  4647	
  4648	"Where to?"
  4649	
  4650	"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late."
  4651	
  4652	"How are you getting on?"
  4653	
  4654	"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self."
  4655	
  4656	I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
  4657	
  4658	I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.
  4659	
  4660	"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."
  4661	
  4662	"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
  4663	
  4664	It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
  4665	
  4666	"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."
  4667	
  4668	"Deserted you?"
  4669	
  4670	"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
  4671	
  4672	" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving
  4673	
  4674	
  4675	" 'MARY.'
  4676	
  4677	"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"
  4678	
  4679	"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."
  4680	
  4681	"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?"
  4682	
  4683	"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"
  4684	
  4685	"I would pay ten."
  4686	
  4687	"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."
  4688	
  4689	With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
  4690	
  4691	With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
  4692	
  4693	"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
  4694	
  4695	The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
  4696	
  4697	"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
  4698	
  4699	"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
  4700	
  4701	"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one."
  4702	
  4703	"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
  4704	
  4705	"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
  4706	
  4707	"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."
  4708	
  4709	"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."
  4710	
  4711	"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"
  4712	
  4713	"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."
  4714	
  4715	"My Mary? Impossible!"
  4716	
  4717	"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening."
  4718	
  4719	"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.
  4720	
  4721	"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.
  4722	
  4723	"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
  4724	
  4725	"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene."
  4726	
  4727	"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
  4728	
  4729	"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."
  4730	
  4731	"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
  4732	
  4733	"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.
  4734	
  4735	"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
  4736	
  4737	"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?
  4738	
  4739	"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.
  4740	
  4741	"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.
  4742	
  4743	"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
  4744	
  4745	"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.
  4746	
  4747	"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."
  4748	
  4749	"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
  4750	
  4751	"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."
  4752	
  4753	XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
  4754	
  4755	
  4756	"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province."
  4757	
  4758	"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."
  4759	
  4760	"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."
  4761	
  4762	"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.
  4763	
  4764	"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."
  4765	
  4766	It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
  4767	
  4768	"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
  4769	
  4770	"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest."
  4771	
  4772	"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.
  4773	
  4774	It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:
  4775	
  4776	"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
  4777	
  4778	
  4779	"VIOLET HUNTER."
  4780	
  4781	"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.
  4782	
  4783	"Not I."
  4784	
  4785	"It is half-past ten now."
  4786	
  4787	"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
  4788	
  4789	"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."
  4790	
  4791	"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."
  4792	
  4793	As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
  4794	
  4795	"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do."
  4796	
  4797	"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."
  4798	
  4799	I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
  4800	
  4801	"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
  4802	
  4803	"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
  4804	
  4805	"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
  4806	
  4807	" 'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
  4808	
  4809	" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.
  4810	
  4811	" 'Yes, sir.'
  4812	
  4813	" 'As governess?'
  4814	
  4815	" 'Yes, sir.'
  4816	
  4817	" 'And what salary do you ask?'
  4818	
  4819	" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'
  4820	
  4821	" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'
  4822	
  4823	" 'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'
  4824	
  4825	" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'
  4826	
  4827	"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
  4828	
  4829	" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
  4830	
  4831	"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.
  4832	
  4833	" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
  4834	
  4835	" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
  4836	
  4837	" 'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'
  4838	
  4839	" 'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
  4840	
  4841	"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
  4842	
  4843	" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'
  4844	
  4845	" 'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'
  4846	
  4847	" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
  4848	
  4849	" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?'
  4850	
  4851	" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
  4852	
  4853	" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'
  4854	
  4855	" 'Oh, no.'
  4856	
  4857	" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
  4858	
  4859	"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
  4860	
  4861	" 'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
  4862	
  4863	" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'
  4864	
  4865	" 'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
  4866	
  4867	" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.'
  4868	
  4869	"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
  4870	
  4871	" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.
  4872	
  4873	" 'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
  4874	
  4875	" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.
  4876	
  4877	"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:
  4878	
  4879	
  4880	" 'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
  4881	
  4882	" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,
  4883	
  4884	
  4885	" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
  4886	
  4887	"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."
  4888	
  4889	"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling.
  4890	
  4891	"But you would not advise me to refuse?"
  4892	
  4893	"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."
  4894	
  4895	"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
  4896	
  4897	"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"
  4898	
  4899	"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"
  4900	
  4901	"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."
  4902	
  4903	"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
  4904	
  4905	"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind."
  4906	
  4907	"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
  4908	
  4909	"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"
  4910	
  4911	"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
  4912	
  4913	Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."
  4914	
  4915	"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.
  4916	
  4917	"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
  4918	
  4919	"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
  4920	
  4921	It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.
  4922	
  4923	The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
  4924	
  4925	"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.
  4926	
  4927	The summons was a brief and urgent one.
  4928	
  4929	"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.
  4930	
  4931	
  4932	"HUNTER."
  4933	
  4934	"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
  4935	
  4936	"I should wish to."
  4937	
  4938	"Just look it up, then."
  4939	
  4940	"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
  4941	
  4942	"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."
  4943	
  4944	By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.
  4945	
  4946	"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
  4947	
  4948	But Holmes shook his head gravely.
  4949	
  4950	"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."
  4951	
  4952	"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"
  4953	
  4954	"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
  4955	
  4956	"You horrify me!"
  4957	
  4958	"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."
  4959	
  4960	"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
  4961	
  4962	"Quite so. She has her freedom."
  4963	
  4964	"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
  4965	
  4966	"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."
  4967	
  4968	The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.
  4969	
  4970	"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
  4971	
  4972	"Pray tell us what has happened to you."
  4973	
  4974	"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
  4975	
  4976	"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
  4977	
  4978	"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them."
  4979	
  4980	"What can you not understand?"

  4982	"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
  4983	
  4984	"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.
  4985	
  4986	"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."
  4987	
  4988	"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."
  4989	
  4990	"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.
  4991	
  4992	"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
  4993	
  4994	" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'
  4995	
  4996	"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.
  4997	
  4998	"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
  4999	
  5000	"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
  5001	
  5002	" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
  5003	
  5004	" 'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
  5005	
  5006	" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'
  5007	
  5008	" 'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'
  5009	
  5010	" 'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
  5011	
  5012	" 'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'
  5013	
  5014	"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."
  5015	
  5016	"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."
  5017	
  5018	"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.
  5019	
  5020	" 'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
  5021	
  5022	"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
  5023	
  5024	" 'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'
  5025	
  5026	"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
  5027	
  5028	"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
  5029	
  5030	"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.
  5031	
  5032	"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.
  5033	
  5034	"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
  5035	
  5036	" 'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.'
  5037	
  5038	"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'
  5039	
  5040	"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.
  5041	
  5042	" 'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
  5043	
  5044	"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.
  5045	
  5046	"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
  5047	
  5048	"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.
  5049	
  5050	" 'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.'
  5051	
  5052	" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
  5053	
  5054	" 'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'
  5055	
  5056	"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.
  5057	
  5058	" 'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'
  5059	
  5060	" 'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
  5061	
  5062	" 'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
  5063	
  5064	" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
  5065	
  5066	" 'I am sure that I do not know.'
  5067	
  5068	" 'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
  5069	
  5070	" 'I am sure if I had known--'
  5071	
  5072	" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
  5073	
  5074	"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do."
  5075	
  5076	Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
  5077	
  5078	"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
  5079	
  5080	"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him."
  5081	
  5082	"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
  5083	
  5084	"Yes."
  5085	
  5086	"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
  5087	
  5088	"Yes, the wine-cellar."
  5089	
  5090	"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman."
  5091	
  5092	"I will try. What is it?"
  5093	
  5094	"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely."
  5095	
  5096	"I will do it."
  5097	
  5098	"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child."
  5099	
  5100	"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
  5101	
  5102	"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power."
  5103	
  5104	"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."
  5105	
  5106	"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."
  5107	
  5108	We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.
  5109	
  5110	"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
  5111	
  5112	A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."
  5113	
  5114	"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."
  5115	
  5116	We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.
  5117	
  5118	"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."
  5119	
  5120	It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
  5121	
  5122	"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."
  5123	
  5124	"But how?"
  5125	
  5126	"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."
  5127	
  5128	"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away."
  5129	
  5130	"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
  5131	
  5132	The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
  5133	
  5134	"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
  5135	
  5136	The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
  5137	
  5138	"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
  5139	
  5140	"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
  5141	
  5142	"I have my revolver," said I.
  5143	
  5144	"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
  5145	
  5146	"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
  5147	
  5148	Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
  5149	
  5150	"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
  5151	
  5152	"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted."
  5153	
  5154	"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
  5155	
  5156	"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
  5157	
  5158	"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
  5159	
  5160	"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.
  5161	
  5162	"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
  5163	
  5164	"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"
  5165	
  5166	"Yes, sir."
  5167	
  5168	"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
  5169	
  5170	"That was it, sir."
  5171	
  5172	"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."
  5173	
  5174	"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.
  5175	
  5176	"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."
  5177	
  5178	"You have it, sir, just as it happened."
  5179	
  5180	"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one."
  5181	
  5182	And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

  5190	Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
  5191	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
  5192	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
  5193	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
  5194	
  5195	We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
  5196	of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
  5197	Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
  5198	even years after the official publication date.
  5199	
  5200	Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
  5201	midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
  5202	The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
  5203	Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
  5204	preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
  5205	and editing by those who wish to do so.

  5211	These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
  5212	Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
  5213	eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).
  5214	
  5215	
  5216	Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
  5217	can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
  5218	also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
  5219	indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
  5220	announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

  5233	We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
  5234	time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
  5235	to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
  5236	searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
  5237	projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
  5238	per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
  5239	million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
  5240	files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
  5241	We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
  5242	If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
  5243	will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.
  5244	
  5245	The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
  5246	This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
  5247	which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

  5281	
  5282	We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
  5283	that have responded.
  5284	
  5285	As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
  5286	will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
  5287	Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.
  5288	
  5289	In answer to various questions we have received on this:
  5290	
  5291	We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
  5292	request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
  5293	you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
  5294	just ask.
  5295	
  5296	While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
  5297	not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
  5298	donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
  5299	donate.
  5300	
  5301	International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
  5302	how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
  5303	deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
  5304	ways.

  5581	PREFACE
  5582	
  5583	
  5584	As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in
  5585	our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
  5586	Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which
  5587	is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
  5588	anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
  5589	grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the
  5590	addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high
  5591	school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving
  5592	fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we
  5593	do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
  5594	study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the
  5595	same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
  5596	multiplication table and fractions.
  5597	
  5598	There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It
  5599	is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
  5600	their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of
  5601	history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing
  5602	methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be
  5603	made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
  5604	languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
  5605	their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive
  5606	historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more
  5607	facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp
  5608	criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
  5609	economics.
  5610	
  5611	In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
  5612	new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one
  5613	of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the
  5614	biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know
  5615	little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
  5616	Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the
  5617	same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It
  5618	is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
  5619	demonstrated to be progressive in character.
  5620	
  5621	In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our
  5622	reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single
  5623	battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
  5624	about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval
  5625	operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To
  5626	dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
  5627	equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who
  5628	compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign
  5629	with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further
  5630	comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
  5631	of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
  5632	warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
  5633	interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that
  5634	deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's
  5635	serious responsibilities.
  5636	
  5637	It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is
  5638	rather upon constructive features.
  5639	
  5640	_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have
  5641	tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of
  5642	each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.
  5643	
  5644	_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to
  5645	explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.
  5646	
  5647	_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
  5648	history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.
  5649	
  5650	_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
  5651	of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.
  5652	These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These
  5653	are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
  5654	understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.
  5655	
  5656	_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
  5657	enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention
  5658	to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
  5659	matter of sound instruction in citizenship.
  5660	
  5661	_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique
  5662	characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we
  5663	have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the
  5664	reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.
  5665	
  5666	_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The
  5667	study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We
  5668	have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,
  5669	reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as
  5670	inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,
  5671	simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
  5672	intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them
  5673	will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.
  5674	The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will
  5675	depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The
  5676	effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
  5677	the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
  5678	information.

  5960	     "THE NATIONS OF THE WEST" (popularly called "The
  5961	     Pioneers"), designed by A. Stirling Calder and modeled by
  5962	     Mr. Calder, F.G.R. Roth, and Leo Lentelli, topped the Arch
  5963	     of the Setting Sun at the Panama-Pacific Exposition held at
  5964	     San Francisco in 1915. Facing the Court of the Universe
  5965	     moves a group of men and women typical of those who have
  5966	     made our civilization. From left to right appear the
  5967	     French-Canadian, the Alaskan, the Latin-American, the
  5968	     German, the Italian, the Anglo-American, and the American
  5969	     Indian, squaw and warrior. In the place of honor in the
  5970	     center of the group, standing between the oxen on the tongue
  5971	     of the prairie schooner, is a figure, beautiful and almost
  5972	     girlish, but strong, dignified, and womanly, the Mother of
  5973	     To-morrow. Above the group rides the Spirit of Enterprise,
  5974	     flanked right and left by the Hopes of the Future in the
  5975	     person of two boys. The group as a whole is beautifully
  5976	     symbolic of the westward march of American civilization.

  5997	THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA
  5998	
  5999	
  6000	The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America
  6001	during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
  6002	the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
  6003	earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,
  6004	westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into
  6005	Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported
  6006	by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
  6007	narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to
  6008	the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the
  6009	Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the
  6010	beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires
  6011	the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only
  6012	one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the
  6013	institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.
  6014	
  6015	In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed
  6016	from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them
  6017	affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
  6018	altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to
  6019	America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
  6020	country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set
  6021	up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also
  6022	political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.
  6023	
  6024	
  6025	THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION
  6026	
  6027	It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of
  6028	water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the
  6029	seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays
  6030	of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
  6031	the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.
  6032	Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
  6033	the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and
  6034	mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,
  6035	adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an
  6036	enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
  6037	gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
  6038	assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy
  6039	proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was
  6040	the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
  6041	beginning.
  6042	
  6043	=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an
  6044	instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
  6045	had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.
  6046	Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
  6047	society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
  6048	particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
  6049	the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it
  6050	received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from
  6051	the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
  6052	control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the
  6053	corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
  6054	affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in
  6055	fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the
  6056	corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,
  6057	they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the
  6058	seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,
  6059	they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The
  6060	stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the
  6061	chief magistrate.
  6062	
  6063	[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY
  6064	COMPANY]
  6065	
  6066	Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the
  6067	trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,
  6068	in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia
  6069	at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,
  6070	chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New
  6071	Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts
  6072	were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated
  6073	in 1629 under the title: "The governor and company of the Massachusetts
  6074	Bay in New England." In this case the law did but incorporate a group
  6075	drawn together by religious ties. "We must be knit together as one man,"
  6076	wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the
  6077	south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company
  6078	in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it
  6079	was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
  6080	rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.
  6081	
  6082	In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the "company
  6083	colonies." It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,
  6084	James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned
  6085	for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George
  6086	II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including
  6087	himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "Trustees
  6088	for establishing the colony of Georgia in America." In the structure of
  6089	their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not
  6090	differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
  6091	colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions
  6092	had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.
  6093	
  6094	=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in
  6095	the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or
  6096	congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
  6097	religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this
  6098	institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a
  6099	potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far
  6100	away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
  6101	heart and of one soul," we are told in the Acts describing the Church at
  6102	Jerusalem. "We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
  6103	the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
  6104	care of each other's good and of the whole," wrote John Robinson, a
  6105	leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in
  6106	1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a
  6107	written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to
  6108	the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until
  6109	Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.
  6110	
  6111	[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]
  6112	
  6113	Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve
  6114	of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
  6115	congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
  6116	Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by
  6117	small bodies of men and women, "united in solemn covenants with the
  6118	Lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a
  6119	year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers
  6120	to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of
  6121	incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation
  6122	of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River
  6123	Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own
  6124	(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the
  6125	towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts
  6126	were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.
  6127	
  6128	Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of
  6129	the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government
  6130	and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The
  6131	towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily
  6132	under their "Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
  6133	the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their "Fundamental
  6134	Articles" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut
  6135	shore had no difficulty in agreeing that "the Scriptures do hold forth a
  6136	perfect rule for the direction and government of all men."
  6137	
  6138	=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the
  6139	proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word
  6140	"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
  6141	granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy
  6142	for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down
  6143	to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and
  6144	powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the
  6145	ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
  6146	and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor
  6147	worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
  6148	common undertaking.
  6149	
  6150	Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,
  6151	owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor
  6152	in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,
  6153	established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
  6154	blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under
  6155	the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American
  6156	union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley
  6157	and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown
  6158	in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
  6159	generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader
  6160	of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
  6161	whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first
  6162	organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
  6163	eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a
  6164	century both became royal provinces governed by the king.

  6167	
  6168	
  6169	THE COLONIAL PEOPLES
  6170	
  6171	=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except
  6172	New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save
  6173	these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
  6174	England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,
  6175	women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." The major portion
  6176	were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With
  6177	them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
  6178	their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and
  6179	Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an
  6180	English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
  6181	America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the
  6182	Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that
  6183	church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;
  6184	and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.
  6185	
  6186	New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and
  6187	1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand
  6188	Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far
  6189	North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater
  6190	portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.
  6191	Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
  6192	England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other
  6193	nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in
  6194	numbers.
  6195	
  6196	The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,
  6197	Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of
  6198	immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
  6199	the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England
  6200	in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that
  6201	"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church." North Carolina was
  6202	first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.
  6203	Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the
  6204	way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how
  6205	little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.
  6206	
  6207	=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were
  6208	the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both
  6209	religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch
  6210	ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland
  6211	whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
  6212	the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
  6213	religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
  6214	woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth
  6215	century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
  6216	their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades
  6217	twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all
  6218	during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
  6219	Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish
  6220	and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of
  6221	the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.
  6222	
  6223	[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
  6224	IMMIGRANTS]
  6225	
  6226	These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,
  6227	Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon
  6228	the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
  6229	already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people
  6230	settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,
  6231	laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
  6232	hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the
  6233	luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
  6234	merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen
  6235	manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
  6236	women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in
  6237	the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:
  6238	
  6239	        "O, willing hands to toil;
  6240	    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;
  6241	    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field."
  6242	
  6243	=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical
  6244	importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in
  6245	colonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
  6246	Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous
  6247	governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and
  6248	Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
  6249	administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
  6250	wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.
  6251	Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
  6252	lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine
  6253	country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought
  6254	more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
  6255	center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old
  6256	New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
  6257	distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered
  6258	to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in
  6259	time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that
  6260	German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
  6261	England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
  6262	dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the
  6263	colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two
  6264	hundred thousand.
  6265	
  6266	The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South
  6267	Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove
  6268	them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also
  6269	among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
  6270	industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,
  6271	dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the
  6272	wealth and independence of the province.
  6273	
  6274	[Illustration: _From an old print_
  6275	
  6276	A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]
  6277	
  6278	Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the
  6279	original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
  6280	built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published
  6281	their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
  6282	and led to occasional agitations against "foreigners." However, no
  6283	serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the
  6284	Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
  6285	armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish
  6286	sections.
  6287	
  6288	=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the
  6289	Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other
  6290	racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing
  6291	their share to colonial life.
  6292	
  6293	From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
  6294	inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.
  6295	
  6296	From "Old Ireland" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and
  6297	Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
  6298	they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed
  6299	upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping
  6300	records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
  6301	the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.
  6302	Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native
  6303	stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
  6304	Celtic names in the records of various colonies.
  6305	
  6306	[Illustration:_From an old print_

  6309	
  6310	The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
  6311	and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete
  6312	liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,
  6313	France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize
  6314	their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going
  6315	habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
  6316	towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the
  6317	mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on
  6318	another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,
  6319	Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large
  6320	Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,
  6321	flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.
  6322	
  6323	Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged
  6324	beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued
  6325	to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English
  6326	conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
  6327	170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
  6328	Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
  6329	manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
  6330	tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;
  6331	but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in
  6332	beside them to farm and trade.
  6333	
  6334	The melting pot had begun its historic mission.
  6335	
  6336	
  6337	THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION
  6338	
  6339	Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the
  6340	emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
  6341	for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on
  6342	the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,
  6343	Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.
  6344	
  6345	=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America
  6346	in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
  6347	and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able
  6348	to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
  6349	Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the
  6350	family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority
  6351	for the statement that "the settlers of New England were drawn from the
  6352	country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother
  6353	country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
  6354	show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and
  6355	good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration
  6356	is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
  6357	behind." Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
  6358	statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
  6359	yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an
  6360	unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
  6361	cost of their own transfer to the New World.
  6362	
  6363	=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants
  6364	were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
  6365	a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great
  6366	barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
  6367	of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
  6368	whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
  6369	money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a
  6370	term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called
  6371	indentured servitude.
  6372	
  6373	It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
  6374	twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the
  6375	Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to
  6376	Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
  6377	women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
  6378	five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
  6379	servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other
  6380	promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
  6381	their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
  6382	moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.
  6383	Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
  6384	and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
  6385	servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with
  6386	fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
  6387	of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the
  6388	eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.
  6389	In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but
  6390	it formed a considerable part of the population.
  6391	
  6392	The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
  6393	things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the
  6394	feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
  6395	They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
  6396	a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It
  6397	was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far
  6398	heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free
  6399	citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
  6400	let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
  6401	was whipped at the post and fined as well.
  6402	
  6403	The ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A
  6404	bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
  6405	trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or
  6406	indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.
  6407	The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
  6408	little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put
  6409	them at the mercy of their masters." It would not be unfair to add that
  6410	such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the
  6411	temper of their masters.
  6412	
  6413	Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the
  6414	Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate
  6415	for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude
  6416	were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or
  6417	settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble
  6418	proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
  6419	out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
  6420	carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
  6421	avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America
  6422	have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.
  6423	
  6424	=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure
  6425	settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America
  6426	either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,
  6427	and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was
  6428	officially estimated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
  6429	America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for
  6430	the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were
  6431	sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.
  6432	In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
  6433	Virginia.
  6434	
  6435	In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
  6436	romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from
  6437	their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
  6438	weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus
  6439	dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of
  6440	five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
  6441	fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
  6442	lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a
  6443	peerage.
  6444	
  6445	Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts
  6446	deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The
  6447	Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
  6448	Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the "criminals" were
  6449	only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant
  6450	caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
  6451	who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
  6452	sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
  6453	were "political criminals"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed
  6454	the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against
  6455	British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against
  6456	the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
  6457	monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who
  6458	joined in political uprisings against the king.
  6459	
  6460	=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
  6461	indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will
  6462	were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When
  6463	this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was
  6464	looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
  6465	of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters
  6466	who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
  6467	system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery
  6468	take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
  6469	supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there
  6470	were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.
  6471	
  6472	The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
  6473	inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in
  6474	New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,
  6475	they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal
  6476	African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
  6477	to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far
  6478	behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.
  6479	
  6480	As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
  6481	rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,
  6482	the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
  6483	the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was
  6484	futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time
  6485	similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South
  6486	Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure
  6487	was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
  6488	by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:
  6489	"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa
  6490	hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
  6491	present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger
  6492	the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply
  6493	impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to
  6494	remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony
  6495	which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
  6496	pernicious a commerce."
  6497	
  6498	All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps
  6499	and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than
  6500	half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,
  6501	and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
  6502	in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
  6503	population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania
  6504	about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the
  6505	proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
  6506	on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one
  6507	in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few
  6508	freedmen.
  6509	
  6510	The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were
  6511	all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,
  6512	though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern
  6513	ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the
  6514	plantations to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult their
  6515	interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
  6516	increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said
  6517	John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the
  6518	Constitution of the United States. "What enriches a part enriches the
  6519	whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"
  6520	responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.

  6612	COLONIAL AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE
  6613	
  6614	THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT
  6615	
  6616	
  6617	=The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may be
  6618	acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
  6619	deep influence on the life and culture of a people. The feudal and
  6620	aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism
  6621	which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,
  6622	the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single
  6623	proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the
  6624	law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his
  6625	landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of
  6626	estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
  6627	owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude
  6628	inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also
  6629	enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
  6630	class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
  6631	political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was
  6632	equally important in the development of America, where practically all
  6633	the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
  6634	livelihood from the soil.
  6635	
  6636	=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad
  6637	extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to
  6638	introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
  6639	and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost
  6640	every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
  6641	was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though
  6642	owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No
  6643	man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:
  6644	"Labor and share alike." All were supposed to work in the fields and
  6645	receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
  6646	attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and
  6647	distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
  6648	the workers.
  6649	
  6650	In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the
  6651	lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
  6652	meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone that gathereth
  6653	not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the
  6654	river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve." Even
  6655	this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until
  6656	each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered
  6657	the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where
  6658	the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar
  6659	to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate
  6660	fields in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
  6661	Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of
  6662	their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
  6663	labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
  6664	the land. "By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not
  6665	carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
  6666	practice."
  6667	
  6668	=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and
  6669	Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
  6670	land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
  6671	of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact
  6672	a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He
  6673	could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
  6674	large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of
  6675	baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
  6676	considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either
  6677	sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
  6678	condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as
  6679	"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
  6680	$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
  6681	source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
  6682	tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
  6683	the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
  6684	land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit
  6685	rent,--"really a feudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
  6686	source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever
  6687	it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
  6688	irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of
  6689	grievances which led to the American Revolution.
  6690	
  6691	Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in
  6692	the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the
  6693	companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there
  6694	were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and
  6695	tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
  6696	tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of
  6697	which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when
  6698	extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
  6699	settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston
  6700	manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
  6701	representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New
  6702	York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European
  6703	estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
  6704	ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial
  6705	power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
  6706	extending to capital punishment.
  6707	
  6708	The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence
  6709	as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge
  6710	estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by
  6711	slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten
  6712	that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
  6713	section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
  6714	America.
  6715	
  6716	[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]
  6717	
  6718	=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and
  6719	throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of
  6720	servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,
  6721	the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
  6722	family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
  6723	immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
  6724	labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the
  6725	crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In
  6726	many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,
  6727	the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
  6728	moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
  6729	German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not
  6730	propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they
  6731	could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
  6732	proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
  6733	small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
  6734	became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the
  6735	farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold
  6736	system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.
  6737	
  6738	[Illustration: _From an old print_
  6739	
  6740	A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]
  6741	
  6742	=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western
  6743	settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
  6744	same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both
  6745	cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
  6746	which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,
  6747	however, differed widely.
  6748	
  6749	The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the
  6750	English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
  6751	labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice
  6752	and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his
  6753	entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,
  6754	silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the
  6755	ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford
  6756	or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for
  6757	his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
  6758	Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native
  6759	goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
  6760	were usually gifted slaves.
  6761	
  6762	The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His
  6763	crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English
  6764	factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed
  6765	local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
  6766	weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
  6767	with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought
  6768	by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not
  6769	buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and
  6770	between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community
  6771	was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great
  6772	plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
  6773	more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New
  6774	West.
  6775	
  6776	=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
  6777	one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of
  6778	an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as
  6779	a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration
  6780	set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over
  6781	mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap
  6782	lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
  6783	breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third
  6784	generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
  6785	mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following
  6786	their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back
  6787	stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular
  6788	settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes
  6789	singly and sometimes in companies.
  6790	
  6791	In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
  6792	Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
  6793	eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west
  6794	until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New
  6795	York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,
  6796	and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,
  6797	particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
  6798	filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New
  6799	Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
  6800	Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of
  6801	advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,
  6802	spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying
  6803	out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the
  6804	Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
  6805	where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties
  6806	a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching
  6807	the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn
  6808	family.
  6809	
  6810	In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was
  6811	quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
  6812	cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from
  6813	the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams
  6814	of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
  6815	other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing
  6816	the main supply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing
  6817	and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully
  6818	occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
  6819	Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of
  6820	home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies."
  6821	
  6822	[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]
  6823	
  6824	Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an
  6825	invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
  6826	early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt
  6827	buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
  6828	Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
  6829	plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers
  6830	followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the
  6831	Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
  6832	times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
  6833	rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution
  6834	there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older
  6835	colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
  6836	the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the
  6837	Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
  6838	fourteenth colony."
  6839	
  6840	
  6841	INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
  6842	
  6843	Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
  6844	a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the
  6845	staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their
  6846	beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
  6847	towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
  6848	numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
  6849	originated in the days when the king of England was "lord of these
  6850	dominions."
  6851	
  6852	[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]
  6853	
  6854	=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in
  6855	addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor
  6856	of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry
  6857	which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in
  6858	abundance in the North and South. "Every farm house," says Coman, the
  6859	economic historian, "was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
  6860	serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear."
  6861	By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth
  6862	in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to
  6863	the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the
  6864	more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
  6865	spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,
  6866	the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "were not
  6867	one whit behind their Yankee neighbors."
  6868	
  6869	The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be
  6870	overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine
  6871	woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the
  6872	government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
  6873	protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and
  6874	statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
  6875	but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of
  6876	the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of
  6877	customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon
  6878	English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.
  6879	
  6880	If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
  6881	trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
  6882	to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
  6883	governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home
  6884	government: "The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
  6885	once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
  6886	England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
  6887	will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
  6888	in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort
  6889	of people this country is inhabited by."
  6890	
  6891	=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron
  6892	working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
  6893	industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
  6894	fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began
  6895	at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
  6896	Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in
  6897	1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had
  6898	iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
  6899	colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and
  6900	the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then
  6901	laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
  6902	the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the
  6903	year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon
  6904	lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.
  6905	Governor Spotswood was called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
  6906	because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems
  6907	that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,
  6908	metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large
  6909	quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the
  6910	colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.
  6911	
  6912	=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,
  6913	shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
  6914	for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope
  6915	made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a
  6916	ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
  6917	shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,
  6918	Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
  6919	Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade
  6920	of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia
  6921	soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal
  6922	the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South
  6923	Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the
  6924	lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
  6925	tar.
  6926	
  6927	=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside
  6928	of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy
  6929	sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished
  6930	under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the
  6931	net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. "Look,"
  6932	exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, "at the manner in
  6933	which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale
  6934	fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
  6935	behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
  6936	and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
  6937	circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
  6938	cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
  6939	serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
  6940	to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
  6941	some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
  6942	Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
  6943	the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No
  6944	climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of
  6945	Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
  6946	of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
  6947	industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
  6948	people."
  6949	
  6950	The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative
  6951	European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught
  6952	for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
  6953	exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The
  6954	lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave
  6955	consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished
  6956	the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These
  6957	activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
  6958	demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
  6959	shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
  6960	towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother
  6961	country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and
  6962	the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an
  6963	ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single
  6964	industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.
  6965	
  6966	=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth
  6967	century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction
  6968	until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
  6969	and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern
  6970	historian has said: "The enterprising merchants of New England developed
  6971	a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world." This
  6972	commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
  6973	mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.
  6974	
  6975	On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and
  6976	agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,
  6977	tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,
  6978	furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
  6979	and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact
  6980	astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an
  6981	American union, once remarked of colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
  6982	you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,
  6983	flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North
  6984	Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,
  6985	and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an
  6986	absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
  6987	discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces."
  6988	
  6989	On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,
  6990	consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and
  6991	"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,
  6992	supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
  6993	and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern
  6994	colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of
  6995	pounds of her capital.
  6996	
  6997	The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part
  6998	controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large
  6999	and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises
  7000	of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the
  7001	Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they
  7002	were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for
  7003	world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages
  7004	they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British
  7005	navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
  7006	contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests
  7007	against outside interference.

  7011	
  7012	Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce
  7013	seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its
  7014	significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English
  7015	colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few
  7016	startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to
  7017	the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American
  7018	Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies
  7019	alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the
  7020	whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first
  7021	date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;
  7022	at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,
  7023	Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in
  7024	1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,
  7025	Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,
  7026	amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the
  7027	colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were
  7028	indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.
  7029	
  7030	=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made
  7031	overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and
  7032	harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
  7033	colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in
  7034	the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for
  7035	goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little
  7036	sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,
  7037	domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,
  7038	or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up
  7039	the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
  7040	the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.
  7041	Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New
  7042	England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
  7043	leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut
  7044	shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to
  7045	Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.
  7046	
  7047	=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry
  7048	there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
  7049	which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
  7050	British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
  7051	ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are
  7052	mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among
  7053	these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,
  7054	and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the
  7055	Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
  7056	somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the "commercial capital of
  7057	Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly smaller than Boston, but
  7058	growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South
  7059	Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a
  7060	center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
  7061	of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as "considerable
  7062	towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in
  7063	Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and
  7064	increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the
  7065	seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,
  7066	Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a
  7067	dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county
  7068	seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,
  7069	and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the
  7070	sessions of the court.
  7071	
  7072	The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
  7073	proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one
  7074	thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and
  7075	artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
  7076	from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,
  7077	gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market
  7078	places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and
  7079	laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main
  7080	currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
  7081	independence.

  7154	
  7155	SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS
  7156	
  7157	
  7158	Colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left
  7159	scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was
  7160	little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
  7161	schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long
  7162	and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
  7163	delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the
  7164	intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
  7165	efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
  7166	of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests
  7167	those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
  7168	thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with
  7169	England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
  7170	political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy
  7171	itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American
  7172	intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the
  7173	writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to
  7174	Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
  7175	Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,
  7176	and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
  7177	something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
  7178	power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
  7179	process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
  7180	evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her
  7181	husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,
  7182	the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British
  7183	propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.
  7184	
  7185	
  7186	THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES
  7187	
  7188	In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high
  7189	importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the
  7190	colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse
  7191	had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all
  7192	the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only
  7193	class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached
  7194	on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of
  7195	local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of
  7196	which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They
  7197	wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the
  7198	colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
  7199	Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces
  7200	the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans
  7201	were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
  7202	authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of
  7203	sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in
  7204	all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
  7205	time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.
  7206	
  7207	=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
  7208	system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were
  7209	prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
  7210	governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. "The
  7211	Established Church," says Lodge, "was one of the appendages of the
  7212	Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,
  7213	and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
  7214	planter who built and managed it." As in England, Catholics and
  7215	Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only
  7216	slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when
  7217	once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
  7218	by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established
  7219	order.
  7220	
  7221	The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
  7222	Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly
  7223	under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of
  7224	the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics
  7225	it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,
  7226	notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was
  7227	fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about
  7228	one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of
  7229	proportion to their numbers.
  7230	
  7231	Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the
  7232	colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official
  7233	class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England
  7234	were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
  7235	acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it
  7236	could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
  7237	counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
  7238	America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had
  7239	a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
  7240	leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
  7241	century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
  7242	Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to
  7243	calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
  7244	Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
  7245	in the mother country.
  7246	
  7247	=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial
  7248	unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims
  7249	had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a
  7250	separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The
  7251	Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,
  7252	soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
  7253	of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was
  7254	organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
  7255	other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where
  7256	secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was
  7257	thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
  7258	enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy
  7259	instead of imperial unity.
  7260	
  7261	The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
  7262	their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for
  7263	the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and
  7264	eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the
  7265	civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan
  7266	Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and
  7267	lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and
  7268	all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.
  7269	A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
  7270	was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout
  7271	Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback
  7272	one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
  7273	him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court
  7274	and fined for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of witchcraft
  7275	the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept
  7276	over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed
  7277	to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.
  7278	
  7279	Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of
  7280	Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it
  7281	with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of
  7282	the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later
  7283	wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
  7284	governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also
  7285	abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
  7286	for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an
  7287	official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
  7288	sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious
  7289	denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were
  7290	permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the
  7291	crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that
  7292	province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
  7293	Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the
  7294	suffrage.
  7295	
  7296	=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of
  7297	Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for
  7298	other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode
  7299	Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in
  7300	matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by
  7301	granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus
  7302	Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to
  7303	the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those "who
  7304	confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the
  7305	creator, upholder, and ruler of the World." By one circumstance or
  7306	another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
  7307	rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
  7308	Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,
  7309	Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
  7310	too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had
  7311	desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where
  7312	one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
  7313	steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,
  7314	and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.
  7315	
  7316	The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
  7317	economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English
  7318	state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy
  7319	of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.
  7320	Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
  7321	articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical
  7322	helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The
  7323	spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,
  7324	nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made
  7325	them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
  7326	authority imposed from without.
  7327	
  7328	
  7329	SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
  7330	
  7331	=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant
  7332	denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this
  7333	work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was
  7334	indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
  7335	whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in
  7336	the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
  7337	book of romance, travel, and history. "Legend and annal," says John
  7338	Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty
  7339	voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission
  7340	journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,
  7341	apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
  7342	the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the
  7343	English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English
  7344	tongue." It was the King James version just from the press that the
  7345	Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.
  7346	
  7347	For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the
  7348	authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon
  7349	their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
  7350	America, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
  7351	in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
  7352	works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was
  7353	scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
  7354	declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
  7355	where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
  7356	writing.

  7378	
  7379	
  7380	
  7381	Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
  7382	with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
  7383	little schools kept by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons."
  7384	Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in
  7385	the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes
  7386	girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,
  7387	fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
  7388	of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show
  7389	that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
  7390	progress all through the eighteenth century.
  7391	
  7392	=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
  7393	establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in
  7394	1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
  7395	"learned and godly ministers" for the Puritan churches of New England.
  7396	To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a
  7397	mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England
  7398	farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New
  7399	Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,
  7400	was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the
  7401	Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William
  7402	and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
  7403	University, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the
  7404	New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
  7405	"republican tendencies" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away
  7406	from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the
  7407	Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
  7408	organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by
  7409	giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
  7410	sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men
  7411	to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
  7412	their country.
  7413	
  7414	=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of
  7415	learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.
  7416	Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in
  7417	England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families
  7418	there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
  7419	of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
  7420	and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or
  7421	any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose
  7422	charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a
  7423	fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was
  7424	limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his
  7425	self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal
  7426	for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on
  7427	theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
  7428	_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with
  7429	secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
  7430	Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
  7431	_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely
  7432	in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
  7433	European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts
  7434	he "attained an acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,
  7435	thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
  7436	for all America at the court of the king of France.
  7437	
  7438	Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found
  7439	all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,
  7440	self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of
  7441	the Revolution.
  7442	
  7443	
  7444	THE COLONIAL PRESS
  7445	
  7446	=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a
  7447	government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of
  7448	political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That
  7449	too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was
  7450	brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an
  7451	official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty
  7452	years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious
  7453	title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not
  7454	been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed
  7455	it for discussing a political question.
  7456	
  7457	Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704
  7458	there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,
  7459	which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
  7460	criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When
  7461	Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_
  7462	about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one
  7463	newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his
  7464	confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette
  7465	or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin
  7466	Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
  7467	newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English
  7468	and one in German.
  7469	
  7470	=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,
  7471	unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
  7472	however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had
  7473	never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
  7474	pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was
  7475	first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical
  7476	authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in
  7477	the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal
  7478	prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;
  7479	and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
  7480	official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,
  7481	with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
  7482	royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the
  7483	restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
  7484	in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by
  7485	failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official
  7486	
  7487	censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so
  7488	active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
  7489	published matter became a sheer impossibility.
  7490	
  7491	In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection
  7492	with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less
  7493	anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from
  7494	the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to
  7495	read"; and so they established a system of official licensing for
  7496	presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was
  7497	more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
  7498	impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
  7499	printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the
  7500	editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the
  7501	proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,
  7502	and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
  7503	A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
  7504	who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who
  7505	ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
  7506	practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
  7507	Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
  7508	approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
  7509	defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
  7510	that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it
  7511	finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
  7512	Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing
  7513	is the freedom of the press.
  7514	
  7515	Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the
  7516	vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
  7517	the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
  7518	almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the
  7519	course of public events and grasp the significance of political
  7520	arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an
  7521	independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
  7522	around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to
  7523	British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person
  7524	who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a
  7525	thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had
  7526	spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's
  7527	Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.
  7528	
  7529	
  7530	THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS
  7531	
  7532	Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.
  7533	The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the
  7534	drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
  7535	England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was
  7536	the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each
  7537	movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the
  7538	passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals
  7539	of government came in the war of independence.
  7540	
  7541	=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were
  7542	royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia
  7543	passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of
  7544	the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost
  7545	its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later
  7546	stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In
  7547	the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were
  7548	given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,
  7549	severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the
  7550	trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,
  7551	transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,
  7552	became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New
  7553	Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was
  7554	brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
  7555	Delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the
  7556	Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
  7557	governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
  7558	of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,
  7559	retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
  7560	had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.
  7561	
  7562	The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
  7563	high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
  7564	turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,
  7565	appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and
  7566	reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief
  7567	of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
  7568	time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except
  7569	Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
  7570	the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
  7571	He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower
  7572	house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
  7573	he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America
  7574	all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had
  7575	protested and Cromwell had battled in England.
  7576	
  7577	[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]
  7578	
  7579	The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
  7580	office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen
  7581	of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The
  7582	pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges
  7583	granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
  7584	popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to
  7585	adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The
  7586	reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which
  7587	they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.
  7588	
  7589	=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
  7590	administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
  7591	tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
  7592	The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
  7593	law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early
  7594	introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
  7595	its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of
  7596	Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
  7597	the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was
  7598	adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative
  7599	system under their "Fundamental Orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
  7600	was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical
  7601	considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William
  7602	Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
  7603	considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every
  7604	one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.
  7605	
  7606	It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was
  7607	finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
  7608	toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to
  7609	be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
  7610	house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
  7611	In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
  7612	of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
  7613	at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In
  7614	Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
  7615	or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
  7616	worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.
  7617	
  7618	Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
  7619	considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of
  7620	the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
  7621	Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
  7622	freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
  7623	of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the
  7624	limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.
  7625	
  7626	The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
  7627	in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by
  7628	the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,
  7629	the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
  7630	interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of
  7631	money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
  7632	treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the
  7633	mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
  7634	officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to
  7635	force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.
  7636	
  7637	=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many
  7638	and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
  7639	and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
  7640	the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
  7641	sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly
  7642	humor, Franklin adds: "Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
  7643	proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
  7644	legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own
  7645	before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value
  7646	of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so
  7647	blessed."
  7648	
  7649	It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
  7650	as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like
  7651	Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
  7652	executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If
  7653	we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America
  7654	was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the
  7655	friends of the governor complained in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
  7656	plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon
  7657	republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of
  7658	royal authority remains in the Northern colonies." "Here," echoed the
  7659	governor of South Carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
  7660	prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if
  7661	he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
  7662	whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the
  7663	assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical
  7664	preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people."
  7665	
  7666	Though baffled by the "levelling principles" of the colonial assemblies,
  7667	the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved
  7668	a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
  7669	obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters
  7670	to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
  7671	officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
  7672	by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was
  7673	to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to
  7674	be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.
  7675	
  7676	Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many
  7677	ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army
  7678	independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
  7679	out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both
  7680	practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh
  7681	from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It
  7682	failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing
  7683	strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
  7684	tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or
  7685	how benevolent its intentions.

  7766	CHAPTER IV
  7767	
  7768	THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM
  7769	
  7770	
  7771	It is one of the well-known facts of history that a people loosely
  7772	united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
  7773	people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact
  7774	body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to common
  7775	defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
  7776	service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside
  7777	interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
  7778	perhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most
  7779	virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "Politics," runs an old
  7780	saying, "stops at the water's edge."
  7781	
  7782	This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
  7783	circles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American
  7784	colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common
  7785	defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it
  7786	has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
  7787	in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. From the earliest
  7788	days of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were
  7789	confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements
  7790	were Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
  7791	as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and
  7792	west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
  7793	the Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British
  7794	empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,
  7795	imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the
  7796	advance of British dominion in America.
  7797	
  7798	
  7799	RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH
  7800	
  7801	=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the
  7802	relations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in
  7803	different shape in different sections of America. It was not handled
  7804	according to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,
  7805	which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither
  7806	did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
  7807	irregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience
  7808	necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties
  7809	arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
  7810	were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened
  7811	was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel
  7812	between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
  7813	exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper
  7814	often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.
  7815	
  7816	On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of
  7817	Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of
  7818	Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William
  7819	Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of
  7820	the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
  7821	frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the
  7822	Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements
  7823	with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A
  7824	generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the
  7825	Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
  7826	the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own
  7827	destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially
  7828	with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and
  7829	desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New
  7830	England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
  7831	Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he
  7832	attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
  7833	Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
  7834	an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt
  7835	and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia
  7836	outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives
  7837	was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
  7838	southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the
  7839	combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.

  7844	
  7845	From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their
  7846	geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
  7847	conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
  7848	full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever
  7849	negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
  7850	with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor
  7851	generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
  7852	especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their
  7853	imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general
  7854	warfare.
  7855	
  7856	[Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,
  7857	1750]
  7858	
  7859	=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French
  7860	exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English
  7861	colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought
  7862	to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in
  7863	1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
  7864	strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was
  7865	the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in
  7866	America, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
  7867	empires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,
  7868	rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
  7869	sounded the first note of colonial alarm.
  7870	
  7871	Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
  7872	English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
  7873	the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's
  7874	War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins
  7875	and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European
  7876	powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles
  7877	with the French and their savage allies.
  7878	
  7879	=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly
  7880	closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be
  7881	seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the
  7882	West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,
  7883	who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed
  7884	by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus
  7885	taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.
  7886	Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they
  7887	occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
  7888	over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this
  7889	lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
  7890	1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper
  7891	waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
  7892	streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,
  7893	in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory "so
  7894	notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain," the
  7895	French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.
  7896

  7898	
  7899	BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]
  7900	
  7901	=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the
  7902	shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French
  7903	and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the
  7904	conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved
  7905	England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and
  7906	minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in
  7907	1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
  7908	dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized
  7909	Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the
  7910	Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were
  7911	triumphant. Well could the historian write: "Conquests equaling in
  7912	rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had
  7913	been achieved in the East." Well could the merchants of London declare
  7914	that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of
  7915	this world-wide conflict, commerce had been "united with and made to
  7916	flourish by war."
  7917	
  7918	From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war
  7919	were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of
  7920	the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The
  7921	remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French
  7922	imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In
  7923	exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain
  7924	ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did
  7925	Macaulay write in after years that Pitt "was the first Englishman of his
  7926	time; and he had made England the first country in the world."
  7927	
  7928	
  7929	THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES
  7930	
  7931	The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as
  7932	they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
  7933	destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular
  7934	assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
  7935	among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The
  7936	American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
  7937	trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the
  7938	arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of
  7939	statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
  7940	tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.
  7941	
  7942	=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with
  7943	the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the
  7944	Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many
  7945	common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly
  7946	fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,
  7947	composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
  7948	colonies so united were bound together in "a firm and perpetual league
  7949	of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
  7950	succor, upon all just occasions." They made provision for distributing
  7951	the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
  7952	commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For
  7953	some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold
  7954	meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate
  7955	border.
  7956	
  7957	Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
  7958	intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the
  7959	Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the
  7960	colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany
  7961	with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of
  7962	mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
  7963	with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.
  7964	
  7965	=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was
  7966	made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a
  7967	conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise
  7968	measures of defense against the French, and to enter into "articles of
  7969	union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's
  7970	subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of
  7971	war." New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,
  7972	Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a
  7973	plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
  7974	adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The
  7975	colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the
  7976	scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that
  7977	it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution."
  7978	Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study
  7979	because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
  7980	until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which
  7981	also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United
  7982	States.
  7983	
  7984	[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]
  7985	
  7986	=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed
  7987	the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
  7988	of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last
  7989	French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to
  7990	the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,
  7991	it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and
  7992	the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands
  7993	of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
  7994	field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that
  7995	were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen
  7996	could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars
  7997	operating on American soil. "This whole transaction," shrewdly remarked
  7998	Franklin of Braddock's campaign, "gave us Americans the first suspicion
  7999	that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not
  8000	been well founded." It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel
  8001	who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the
  8002	army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had "spurned the
  8003	whistle of bullets" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.
  8004	
  8005	=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were
  8006	learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the
  8007	conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left
  8008	New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was
  8009	especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
  8010	the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper
  8011	currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce
  8012	was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the
  8013	end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy
  8014	liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
  8015	accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
  8016	ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
  8017	had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel
  8018	which led to American independence.
  8019	
  8020	=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the
  8021	defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to
  8022	estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
  8023	that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no
  8024	foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
  8025	American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis
  8026	were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
  8027	to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,
  8028	though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,
  8029	as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by
  8030	Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the
  8031	Revolution.
  8032	
  8033	
  8034	COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
  8035	
  8036	It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought
  8037	forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife
  8038	with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
  8039	independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the
  8040	colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of
  8041	events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control
  8042	over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be
  8043	taken into account.
  8044	
  8045	=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
  8046	and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime
  8047	(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had
  8048	little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
  8049	affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
  8050	internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
  8051	House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II
  8052	(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
  8053	by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
  8054	powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same
  8055	time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
  8056	the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so
  8057	much self-government on the Puritans.
  8058	
  8059	Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
  8060	authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
  8061	inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he
  8062	would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
  8063	dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
  8064	He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more
  8065	efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He
  8066	made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New
  8067	York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last
  8068	days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
  8069	Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
  8070	hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.
  8071	
  8072	For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of
  8073	ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
  8074	accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his
  8075	opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the
  8076	Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
  8077	a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle
  8078	of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
  8079	that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people
  8080	of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to
  8081	dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated
  8082	governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under
  8083	guard.
  8084	
  8085	The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary
  8086	and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the
  8087	colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was
  8088	given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
  8089	restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the
  8090	other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of
  8091	affairs was resumed.
  8092	
  8093	=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of
  8094	Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a
  8095	Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,
  8096	was more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,
  8097	whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to
  8098	speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of
  8099	taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
  8100	stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no
  8101	ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.
  8102	Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs
  8103	was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
  8104	his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: "Let
  8105	sleeping dogs lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
  8106	by exclaiming: "I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
  8107	expense of blood." Such kings and such ministers were not likely to
  8108	arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
  8109	sea.
  8110	
  8111	=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from
  8112	James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters
  8113	personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
  8114	officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision
  8115	began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the
  8116	king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider
  8117	petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696
  8118	a regular board was established, known as the "Lords of Trade and
  8119	Plantations," which continued, until the American Revolution, to
  8120	scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were
  8121	to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those
  8122	assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
  8123	colonies relative to their affairs.
  8124	
  8125	The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by
  8126	American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.
  8127	If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
  8128	exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person
  8129	who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
  8130	could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
  8131	was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
  8132	involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
  8133	therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the
  8134	suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in
  8135	addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
  8136	provinces.
  8137	
  8138	=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the
  8139	colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The
  8140	king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high
  8141	appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right
  8142	of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
  8143	on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in
  8144	England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
  8145	any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,
  8146	had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the
  8147	king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
  8148	the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court
  8149	could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
  8150	enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were
  8151	contrary to English law.
  8152	
  8153	=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year
  8154	after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
  8155	colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in
  8156	the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
  8157	duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North
  8158	Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as
  8159	"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures
  8160	throughout the continent." At other times, Indian trade was regulated in
  8161	the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
  8162	legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
  8163	North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.
  8164	
  8165	In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
  8166	higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the
  8167	Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to
  8168	regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.
  8169	A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the
  8170	Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the
  8171	colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In
  8172	the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
  8173	rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of
  8174	British imperial control over the American colonies.
  8175	
  8176	So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies
  8177	had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As
  8178	common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
  8179	arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with
  8180	the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
  8181	enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
  8182	common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the
  8183	repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
  8184	Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.
  8185	
  8186	=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament
  8187	gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the
  8188	American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of
  8189	Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense
  8190	body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of
  8191	America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
  8192	all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas
  8193	plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
  8194	interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
  8195	got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the
  8196	British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
  8197	raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.
  8198	
  8199	_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of
  8200	British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
  8201	the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so
  8202	essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and
  8203	French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
  8204	it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II
  8205	(1660-85).
  8206	
  8207	The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
  8208	British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and
  8209	her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No
  8210	European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the
  8211	country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were
  8212	almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the
  8213	colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse
  8214	effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
  8215	shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave
  8216	the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother
  8217	country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
  8218	policy written into the Navigation Acts.
  8219	
  8220	_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was
  8221	deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
  8222	sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may
  8223	be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen
  8224	goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
  8225	colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New
  8226	England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending
  8227	large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
  8228	and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,
  8229	dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
  8230	or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
  8231	whatever." The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
  8232	ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
  8233	industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were
  8234	given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw
  8235	material; but at the same time the law provided that "no mill or other
  8236	engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a
  8237	tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
  8238	colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public
  8239	nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of
  8240	the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the
  8241	ban.
  8242	
  8243	_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the
  8244	British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
  8245	1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain
  8246	or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
  8247	the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom
  8248	duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual
  8249	commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
  8250	articles" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest
  8251	coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,
  8252	however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
  8253	articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,
  8254	hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies
  8255	were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English
  8256	ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
  8257	again.
  8258	
  8259	_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of
  8260	English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the
  8261	British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch
  8262	neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
  8263	with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar
  8264	and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting
  8265	on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,
  8266	Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on
  8267	sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
  8268	countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the
  8269	French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were
  8270	not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
  8271	merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.
  8272	
  8273	=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly
  8274	of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the
  8275	policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the
  8276	restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
  8277	favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,
  8278	redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers
  8279	of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British
  8280	ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
  8281	and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage
  8282	colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in
  8283	the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
  8284	colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial
  8285	legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when
  8286	free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves
  8287	handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
  8288	and the recipients of bounties in English markets.
  8289	
  8290	Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
  8291	against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
  8292	enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively
  8293	few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
  8294	in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America
  8295	to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
  8296	the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
  8297	and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was
  8298	not the sole support of any considerable number of people.
  8299	
  8300	As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
  8301	relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were
  8302	boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
  8303	English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and
  8304	molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New
  8305	England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against
  8306	smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed
  8307	in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
  8308	restraints of trade" until after the French war, when the British
  8309	government suddenly entered upon a new course.
  8310	
  8311	
  8312	SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD
  8313	
  8314	In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,
  8315	in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of
  8316	a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent
  8317	to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of
  8318	migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and
  8319	nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical
  8320	importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot
  8321	were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands
  8322	of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as
  8323	domestic servants in the North.
  8324	
  8325	Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims
  8326	and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and
  8327	Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments
  8328	that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of
  8329	their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
  8330	the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the
  8331	negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of
  8332	adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
  8333	enterprising merchants.
  8334	
  8335	How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
  8336	and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other
  8337	cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it
  8338	was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who
  8339	undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their
  8340	own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years
  8341	in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account
  8342	of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.
  8343	
  8344	Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get
  8345	across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down
  8346	forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,
  8347	schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and
  8348	wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and
  8349	traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
  8350	commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
  8351	Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
  8352	they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
  8353	were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.
  8354	
  8355	Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
  8356	the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major
  8357	portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the
  8358	literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the
  8359	colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a
  8360	wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
  8361	necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and
  8362	later against the French. They were all subjects of the same
  8363	sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for
  8364	them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their
  8365	trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common
  8366	grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.
  8367	
  8368	Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
  8369	them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them
  8370	were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
  8371	it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
  8372	The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the
  8373	Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each
  8374	colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it
  8375	grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a
  8376	people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to
  8377	strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of
  8378	colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
  8379	which they were designed to quench.
  8380	
  8381	Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the
  8382	assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection
  8383	of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
  8384	wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were
  8385	controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
  8386	great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the
  8387	earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and
  8388	merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
  8389	which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their
  8390	industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
  8391	Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is
  8392	not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A
  8393	thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
  8394	to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a
  8395	destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British
  8396	empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
  8397	America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the
  8398	spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
  8399	Washington.

  8486	THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY
  8487	
  8488	
  8489	On October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to
  8490	his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover
  8491	and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never
  8492	even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.
  8493	The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English
  8494	with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During
  8495	their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did
  8496	not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
  8497	Parliament.
  8498	
  8499	
  8500	GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM
  8501	
  8502	=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the
  8503	German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a
  8504	foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.
  8505	To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular
  8506	phrase: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
  8507	Briton." Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for
  8508	high royal prerogative, said of George: "The young king was a born
  8509	Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
  8510	portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,
  8511	his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
  8512	public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were
  8513	pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without
  8514	glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."
  8515	
  8516	Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and
  8517	his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty
  8518	notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
  8519	the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His
  8520	mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: "George, be king!" Lord
  8521	Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him
  8522	to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
  8523	laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
  8524	him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all
  8525	parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.
  8526	
  8527	[Illustration: _From an old print._
  8528	
  8529	GEORGE III]
  8530	
  8531	=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties
  8532	favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
  8533	the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
  8534	freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant
  8535	non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
  8536	continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
  8537	their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up
  8538	all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they
  8539	still cherished their old notions about divine right. With the
  8540	accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
  8541	around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open
  8542	arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.
  8543	
  8544	=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British
  8545	Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
  8546	with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first
  8547	place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
  8548	number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as
  8549	of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by
  8550	popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great
  8551	towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no
  8552	representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants
  8553	in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is
  8554	to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
  8555	government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons
  8556	although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
  8557	voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
  8558	lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.
  8559	The "rotten-boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
  8560	scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into
  8561	the House of Commons.
  8562	
  8563	
  8564	GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES
  8565	
  8566	=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of
  8567	George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him
  8568	with "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
  8569	direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's
  8570	confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,
  8571	a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
  8572	cost of government.
  8573	
  8574	The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
  8575	of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest
  8576	point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely
  8577	necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention
  8578	finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a
  8579	zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public
  8580	service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
  8581	governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire
  8582	ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new system of colonial
  8583	government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more
  8584	requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but
  8585	that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
  8586	Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to
  8587	be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
  8588	expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation."
  8589	
  8590	=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed
  8591	before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
  8592	paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a
  8593	remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
  8594	authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This
  8595	law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the Americans were fond of
  8596	making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
  8597	English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
  8598	principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long
  8599	battle over sound money on this continent.
  8600	
  8601	=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)
  8602	George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,
  8603	for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
  8604	Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree
  8605	touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's
  8606	officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
  8607	been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on
  8608	settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and
  8609	"squatting" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without
  8610	authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases
  8611	from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
  8612	and dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same
  8613	proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,
  8614	including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in
  8615	the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise
  8616	were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
  8617	preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.
  8618	
  8619	=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
  8620	attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under
  8621	which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
  8622	America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
  8623	that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
  8624	upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this
  8625	reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was
  8626	set forth clearly in the title: "An act for granting certain duties in
  8627	the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the
  8628	produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,
  8629	protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
  8630	more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
  8631	from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
  8632	trade between the same and Great Britain." The old Molasses Act had been
  8633	prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
  8634	measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
  8635	and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement
  8636	of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had
  8637	"teeth in it." Special precautions as to bonds, security, and
  8638	registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised
  8639	a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.
  8640	
  8641	The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative
  8642	measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
  8643	vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,
  8644	search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
  8645	ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in
  8646	America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
  8647	navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
  8648	royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
  8649	in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge
  8650	of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
  8651	naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
  8652	large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.
  8653	
  8654	=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved
  8655	steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration
  8656	in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next
  8657	year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded
  8658	its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
  8659	while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
  8660	of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received
  8661	royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of
  8662	colonial agents in London were futile. "We might as well have hindered
  8663	the sun's progress!" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in
  8664	the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and
  8665	from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid
  8666	interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful
  8667	measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
  8668	act for the king when he was incapacitated.
  8669	
  8670	The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British
  8671	government to raise revenue in America "towards defraying the expenses
  8672	of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and
  8673	plantations in America." It was a long measure of more than fifty
  8674	sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions
  8675	duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
  8676	transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
  8677	licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing
  8678	cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
  8679	advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything
  8680	escaped.
  8681	
  8682	=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp
  8683	Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not
  8684	conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General
  8685	Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous
  8686	warning in the Commons. "Believe me--remember I this day told you so--"
  8687	he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
  8688	first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties
  8689	and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." The
  8690	answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
  8691	Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
  8692	soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
  8693	Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the
  8694	colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
  8695	the new laws. "We have the power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
  8696	"and we will tax them."
  8697	
  8698	
  8699	COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL
  8700	
  8701	=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an
  8702	outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the
  8703	lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
  8704	import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,
  8705	some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
  8706	intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
  8707	papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had
  8708	long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested
  8709	against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old
  8710	England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many
  8711	of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
  8712	Whig aristocrats as "seditious, factious and republican." Yet the
  8713	opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering
  8714	Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.
  8715	
  8716	In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
  8717	countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,
  8718	there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to
  8719	resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were
  8720	known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including
  8721	artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both
  8722	groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
  8723	affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the
  8724	right to vote for colonial assemblymen.
  8725	
  8726	While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
  8727	drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of
  8728	Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred
  8729	up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts
  8730	were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of
  8731	high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by
  8732	threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use
  8733	of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations
  8734	to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
  8735	frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
  8736	unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very
  8737	effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
  8738	domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture
  8739	of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to
  8740	feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.
  8741	
  8742	=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial
  8743	assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the
  8744	popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,
  8745	the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
  8746	that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
  8747	upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
  8748	"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust." It was in support of these
  8749	resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: "Caesar
  8750	had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries of
  8751	"Treason" were calmly met by the orator who finished: "George III may
  8752	profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it."
  8753	
  8754	[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]
  8755	
  8756	=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call
  8757	of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to
  8758	be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded
  8759	and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest
  8760	affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record
  8761	a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They
  8762	declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given
  8763	through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed
  8764	a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
  8765	acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the
  8766	king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made "humble
  8767	supplication" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.
  8768	
  8769	The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked
  8770	the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.
  8771	It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
  8772	government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
  8773	of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt
  8774	at union. "There ought to be no New England men," declared Christopher
  8775	Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, "no New Yorkers known on the
  8776	Continent, but all of us Americans."
  8777	
  8778	=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American
  8779	resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies
  8780	had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging
  8781	at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,
  8782	Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England
  8783	were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was
  8784	reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.
  8785	
  8786	Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the
  8787	bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for
  8788	Pennsylvania, who was in London. "Do you think it right," asked
  8789	Grenville, "that America should be protected by this country and pay no
  8790	part of the expenses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the case; the
  8791	colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five
  8792	thousand men and spent many millions." Then came an inquiry whether the
  8793	colonists would accept a modified stamp act. "No, never," replied
  8794	Franklin, "never! They will never submit to it!" It was next suggested
  8795	that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready
  8796	answer. "They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a
  8797	rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."
  8798	
  8799	The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days
  8800	later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts
  8801	due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,
  8802	workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the
  8803	colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close
  8804	of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor
  8805	of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.
  8806	"America must learn," he wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
  8807	Caesar through riot and sedition." His protests were idle. The Commons
  8808	agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
  8809	victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of
  8810	strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
  8811	restored to his right mind.
  8812	
  8813	In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of
  8814	the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it
  8815	accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the
  8816	colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;
  8817	that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
  8818	laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
  8819	resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
  8820	null and void.
  8821	
  8822	The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
  8823	demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
  8824	trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper
  8825	resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
  8826	the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the
  8827	news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically
  8828	restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend
  8829	inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."
  8830	
  8831	
  8832	RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES
  8833	
  8834	=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.
  8835	Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and
  8836	seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness
  8837	gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.
  8838	Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought
  8839	forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,
  8840	which to this day are associated with his name. First among his
  8841	restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement
  8842	of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
  8843	in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in
  8844	the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all
  8845	control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a
  8846	tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into
  8847	the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
  8848	the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
  8849	officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the
  8850	tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This
  8851	law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in
  8852	England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea
  8853	merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea
  8854	smugglers.
  8855	
  8856	=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been
  8857	content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
  8858	and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of
  8859	the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the
  8860	harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at
  8861	their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,
  8862	1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
  8863	issue "writs of assistance," empowering customs officers to enter "any
  8864	house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies
  8865	or plantations in America to search for and seize" prohibited or
  8866	smuggled goods.
  8867	
  8868	The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to
  8869	revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
  8870	cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
  8871	gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "minion of the law"
  8872	to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much
  8873	for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for
  8874	self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
  8875	establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.
  8876	
  8877	The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
  8878	illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
  8879	time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
  8880	arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
  8881	Massachusetts court for writs of assistance "as usual." This application
  8882	was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
  8883	speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
  8884	away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." Otis denounced
  8885	the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
  8886	his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the
  8887	liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
  8888	possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
  8889	spread terror and desolation through the land. "What a scene," he
  8890	exclaimed, "does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
  8891	or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a
  8892	writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
  8893	exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
  8894	blood." He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament
  8895	could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.
  8896	This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly
  8897	echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to
  8898	America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
  8899	"Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the child Independence was born."
  8900	Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of
  8901	customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.
  8902	
  8903	=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's
  8904	Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.
  8905	The assembly of New York, protesting against the "ruinous and
  8906	insupportable" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
  8907	care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering
  8908	Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
  8909	obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance
  8910	with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the
  8911	meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
  8912	representative bodies rested.
  8913	
  8914	
  8915	RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA
  8916	
  8917	=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the
  8918	leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed
  8919	intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a
  8920	Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
  8921	informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly
  8922	condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that
  8923	Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent
  8924	and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
  8925	represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to
  8926	consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
  8927	who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
  8928	paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,
  8929	in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
  8930	predicament in which they were all placed.
  8931	
  8932	[Illustration: _From an old print._
  8933	
  8934	SAMUEL ADAMS]
  8935	
  8936	=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing
  8937	of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On
  8938	meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and
  8939	South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also
  8940	dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
  8941	passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of
  8942	imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
  8943	the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of
  8944	persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the
  8945	king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution
  8946	of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal
  8947	governor.
  8948	
  8949	=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities
  8950	kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of
  8951	citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
  8952	the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British
  8953	goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about
  8954	the patronage of home products still more loyally.
  8955	
  8956	On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to
  8957	jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things
  8958	went from bad to worse until some "boys and young fellows" began to
  8959	throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
  8960	crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
  8961	"massacre," a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was
  8962	sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated
  8963	and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded
  8964	and ordered the regulars away.
  8965	
  8966	The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.
  8967	Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.
  8968	Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
  8969	John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst
  8970	
  8971	offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the
  8972	jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,
  8973	saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
  8974	town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
  8975	the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.
  8976	
  8977	=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
  8978	citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,
  8979	openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven
  8980	who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal
  8981	troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,
  8982	called the "Lexington of the South."
  8983	
  8984	=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as
  8985	well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
  8986	broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for
  8987	smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was
  8988	caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the
  8989	vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,
  8990	sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to
  8991	account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very
  8992	appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to
  8993	action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution
  8994	creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
  8995	among the colonies in resistance to British measures.
  8996	
  8997	=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the
  8998	Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
  8999	that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
  9000	commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,
  9001	Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the
  9002	financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
  9003	Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
  9004	return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on
  9005	all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be
  9006	collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
  9007	in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the
  9008	colonists.
  9009	
  9010	This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
  9011	colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one
  9012	thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it
  9013	promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of
  9014	cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large
  9015	stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who
  9016	were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an
  9017	irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New
  9018	York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
  9019	roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,
  9020	disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
  9021	into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,
  9022	determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed
  9023	it.
  9024	
  9025	
  9026	RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
  9027	
  9028	=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in
  9029	Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no
  9030	soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. "The die is cast," he
  9031	stated with evident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triumph or
  9032	submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very
  9033	meek." Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as "the
  9034	proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
  9035	the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not
  9036	trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
  9037	understand." This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of
  9038	Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.
  9039	Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in
  9040	upholding its authority.
  9041	
  9042	=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,
  9043	passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five
  9044	"intolerable acts." They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The
  9045	_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to
  9046	commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,
  9047	revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
  9048	the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should
  9049	be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
  9050	certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A
  9051	_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
  9052	government" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to
  9053	Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
  9054	persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.
  9055	The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts
  9056	towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
  9057	religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries
  9058	of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western
  9059	region, government by a viceroy.
  9060	
  9061	The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary
  9062	celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was
  9063	ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,
  9064	condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
  9065	showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He
  9066	was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both
  9067	houses without a division, the entry "unanimous" being made upon their
  9068	journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.
  9069	The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a
  9070	vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
  9071	one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in Boston,"
  9072	exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, "is the overt act of High
  9073	Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight." The
  9074	crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.
  9075	
  9076	In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the
  9077	American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
  9078	project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
  9079	attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The
  9080	British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics
  9081	either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive
  9082	in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because
  9083	Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,
  9084	large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.
  9085	
  9086	To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British
  9087	government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed
  9088	forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of
  9089	Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King
  9090	George was to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
  9091	medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.
  9092	
  9093	
  9094	FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA
  9095	
  9096	=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the
  9097	destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
  9098	a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the
  9099	British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "rights as Englishmen"
  9100	and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the
  9101	principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When
  9102	they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
  9103	for support to their "natural rights." The latter doctrine, in the form
  9104	in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the
  9105	constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in
  9106	defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American
  9107	leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
  9108	the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did
  9109	not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the
  9110	crown. "Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things," retorted
  9111	Otis when the constitutional argument failed. "A time may come when
  9112	Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,
  9113	inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
  9114	would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
  9115	until the general conflagration." Of the same opinion was the young and
  9116	impetuous Alexander Hamilton. "The sacred rights of mankind," he
  9117	exclaimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
  9118	records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
  9119	destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
  9120	obscured by mortal power."
  9121	
  9122	Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their
  9123	rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
  9124	hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly
  9125	avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
  9126	language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a
  9127	firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
  9128	concessions from England. "I argue this cause with the greater
  9129	pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
  9130	assistance, "as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in
  9131	opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods
  9132	cost one king of England his head and another his throne."
  9133	
  9134	=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of
  9135	American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
  9136	Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
  9137	American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He
  9138	saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American
  9139	spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that
  9140	there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
  9141	three. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
  9142	the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
  9143	in the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to
  9144	prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his
  9145	countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
  9146	against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
  9147	government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." The third and
  9148	right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the
  9149	American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies
  9150	into equal partnership.
  9151	
  9152	=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,
  9153	was equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To
  9154	their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American
  9155	resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their
  9156	view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and that very
  9157	act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:
  9158	"Facts are stubborn things." Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers
  9159	were visible to the veriest street urchin. "Now," said Gouverneur
  9160	Morris, "the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
  9161	It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British
  9162	constitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
  9163	historians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his
  9164	understanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On
  9165	Conciliation with America_.

  9249	
  9250	
  9251	RESISTANCE AND RETALIATION
  9252	
  9253	=The Continental Congress.=--When the news of the "intolerable acts"
  9254	reached America, every one knew what strong medicine Parliament was
  9255	prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority. The
  9256	cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition
  9257	to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
  9258	character. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a
  9259	Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,
  9260	1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons
  9261	was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
  9262	during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in
  9263	Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America
  9264	were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John
  9265	and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was
  9266	represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored
  9267	moderation.
  9268	
  9269	The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in
  9270	clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It
  9271	approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and
  9272	promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to
  9273	King George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of
  9274	independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British
  9275	government.
  9276	
  9277	=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,
  9278	with professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary
  9279	step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,
  9280	and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
  9281	"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by the qualified
  9282	voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw
  9283	itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and
  9284	to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within
  9285	the British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.
  9286	The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose
  9287	one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the
  9288	non-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought
  9289	English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--"May Britain
  9290	be wise and America be free"--the first Continental Congress adjourned
  9291	in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting
  9292	of a second Congress, should necessity require.
  9293	
  9294	=Lord North's "Olive Branch."=--When the news of the action of the
  9295	American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
  9296	of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime
  9297	minister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
  9298	to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
  9299	imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
  9300	the crown. This "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
  9301	the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
  9302	the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
  9303	commerce of New England.
  9304	
  9305	=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the
  9306	British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
  9307	upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military
  9308	stores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize
  9309	them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.
  9310	At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that
  9311	produced "the great event." An unexpected collision beyond the thought
  9312	or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
  9313	battle field.
  9314	
  9315	=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
  9316	was actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at
  9317	Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
  9318	beyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
  9319	colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
  9320	war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
  9321	Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was
  9322	unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
  9323	the offensive acts of Parliament.
  9324	
  9325	=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America
  9326	were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on
  9327	August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This
  9328	announcement declared that the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
  9329	ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection; it called on the
  9330	civil and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
  9331	threatened with "condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and
  9332	abettors of such traitorous designs." It closed with the usual prayer:
  9333	"God, save the king." Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping
  9334	act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was
  9335	silent at last. Force was also America's answer.
  9336	
  9337	
  9338	AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE
  9339	
  9340	=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of
  9341	reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
  9342	to defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the
  9343	militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,
  9344	into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
  9345	It assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage
  9346	war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.
  9347	
  9348	[Illustration: _From an old print_
  9349	
  9350	SPIRIT OF 1776]
  9351	
  9352	Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by
  9353	the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British
  9354	regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command
  9355	of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments
  9356	in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,
  9357	the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of
  9358	Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
  9359	of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to
  9360	America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
  9361	of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative
  9362	historian Lecky: "The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to
  9363	subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made
  9364	reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable." The news of this
  9365	wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America
  9366	before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington
  9367	had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with
  9368	his entire army for Halifax.
  9369	
  9370	=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were
  9371	bearing the Americans away from their old position under the British
  9372	constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their
  9373	desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
  9374	them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
  9375	revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In
  9376	all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour
  9377	was being debated. "American independence," as the historian Bancroft
  9378	says, "was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
  9379	assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
  9380	and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
  9381	coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the
  9382	pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county
  9383	conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
  9384	assemblies."

  9389	
  9390	=Paine's "Commonsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of American
  9391	opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
  9392	public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and
  9393	without apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the
  9394	first of his famous tracts, "Commonsense," a passionate attack upon the
  9395	British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.
  9396	Casting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto
  9397	addressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
  9398	with many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system
  9399	which had laid the world "in blood and ashes." Instead of praising the
  9400	British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
  9401	rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was "owing
  9402	to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the
  9403	government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in
  9404	Turkey."
  9405	
  9406	Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
  9407	order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
  9408	separation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of
  9409	practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
  9410	mother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
  9411	in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty
  9412	in behalf of independence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any market
  9413	in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we
  9414	will." As to matters of government, "it is not in the power of Britain
  9415	to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too
  9416	weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
  9417	convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."
  9418	
  9419	There is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.
  9420	"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of
  9421	the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
  9422	Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the
  9423	choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The
  9424	sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a
  9425	city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not
  9426	the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the
  9427	contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
  9428	proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and
  9429	honor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the
  9430	tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be
  9431	extinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,
  9432	an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
  9433	mankind and of the free and independent states of America." As more than
  9434	100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots
  9435	exclaimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"
  9436	
  9437	=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the
  9438	idea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of
  9439	February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,
  9440	advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
  9441	for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way
  9442	by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
  9443	complete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the
  9444	neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
  9445	others shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to
  9446	concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
  9447	independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly
  9448	responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May
  9449	15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence
  9450	of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of
  9451	separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the
  9452	state house was lowered for all time.
  9453	
  9454	Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events
  9455	outside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. "Are
  9456	we rebels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.
  9457	"No: we must declare ourselves a free people." Others hesitated and
  9458	spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. "Is
  9459	not America already independent?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
  9460	"Why not then declare it?" Still there was uncertainty and delegates
  9461	avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,
  9462	Congress declared that the authority of the British crown in America
  9463	must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
  9464	their own.
  9465	
  9466	[Illustration: _From an old print_
  9467	
  9468	THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF
  9469	INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]
  9470	
  9471	=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
  9472	on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that "these
  9473	united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
  9474	states." A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
  9475	document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the
  9476	states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political
  9477	connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft
  9478	of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,
  9479	was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
  9480	out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
  9481	hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among
  9482	the powers of the world.
  9483	
  9484	To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence
  9485	is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but
  9486	patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of
  9487	its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
  9488	the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
  9489	that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
  9490	ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
  9491	throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down
  9492	thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
  9493	battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That
  9494	ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
  9495	sentence: "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
  9496	governed."
  9497	
  9498	Written in a "decent respect for the opinions of mankind," to set forth
  9499	the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from
  9500	Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of "abuses and
  9501	usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the government of King
  9502	George. That section of the Declaration has passed into "ancient"
  9503	history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for
  9504	government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
  9505	household phrase in the Old World as in the New.
  9506	
  9507	In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
  9508	from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of
  9509	revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
  9510	Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the
  9511	pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these
  9512	rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
  9513	governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
  9514	these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
  9515	institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and
  9516	organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
  9517	effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
  9518	drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every
  9519	privilege not founded on popular assent.
  9520	
  9521	
  9522	THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE
  9523	
  9524	=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into
  9525	armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
  9526	forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for
  9527	the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
  9528	committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were
  9529	in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
  9530	groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.
  9531	As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston
  9532	under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent
  9533	emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education
  9534	in the doctrines of liberty.
  9535	
  9536	[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE
  9537	DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]
  9538	
  9539	Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee
  9540	were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,
  9541	congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the
  9542	revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
  9543	the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
  9544	controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
  9545	built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the
  9546	Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the
  9547	United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the
  9548	British empire in America.
  9549	
  9550	=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of
  9551	the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal
  9552	provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
  9553	and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to
  9554	the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
  9555	themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
  9556	Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
  9557	Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions
  9558	as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and
  9559	Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
  9560	needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
  9561	before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,
  9562	which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
  9563	complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much
  9564	deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
  9565	essential features remains unchanged to-day.
  9566	
  9567	The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
  9568	models. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
  9569	chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and
  9570	Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was
  9571	substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or
  9572	assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property
  9573	restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was
  9574	continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
  9575	deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several
  9576	constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated
  9577	that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
  9578	experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John
  9579	Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a
  9580	government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
  9581	mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were
  9582	allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.
  9583	
  9584	By the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of
  9585	authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
  9586	and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
  9587	time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared
  9588	by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in
  9589	Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
  9590	a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the
  9591	democratic revolution in the Old World.
  9592	
  9593	=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions
  9594	was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build
  9595	on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of
  9596	government was another matter. There had always been, it must be
  9597	remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans
  9598	had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the
  9599	crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
  9600	accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for
  9601	action on a national stage.
  9602	
  9603	Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of
  9604	national destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce
  9605	and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There
  9606	were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
  9607	for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local
  9608	pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
  9609	provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
  9610	the common enterprise.
  9611	
  9612	Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
  9613	federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work
  9614	before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
  9615	permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go
  9616	into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,
  9617	undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again
  9618	presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed
  9619	and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states
  9620	the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed
  9621	ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
  9622	surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the
  9623	states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all
  9624	that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a
  9625	chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a
  9626	Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
  9627	the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
  9628	government--money and soldiers.
  9629	
  9630	=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were
  9631	taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
  9632	and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
  9633	the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental
  9634	Congress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it
  9635	provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such
  9636	agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
  9637	opponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those
  9638	who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or
  9639	punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state
  9640	constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the
  9641	same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
  9642	the new order of things.
  9643	
  9644	[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]
  9645	
  9646	These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
  9647	were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to
  9648	sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
  9649	Those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
  9650	more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at
  9651	one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
  9652	York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The
  9653	black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
  9654	persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who
  9655	were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were
  9656	suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in
  9657	the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
  9658	proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.
  9659	
  9660	The work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
  9661	sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without
  9662	trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake
  9663	of ice and held there "until his loyalty to King George might cool."
  9664	Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
  9665	they could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British
  9666	government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,
  9667	but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well
  9668	as a war for independence, was being waged.
  9669	
  9670	=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who
  9671	were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
  9672	preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the
  9673	Americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
  9674	British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution
  9675	was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have
  9676	conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a
  9677	careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
  9678	of the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third
  9679	opposed the Revolution at all stages.
  9680	
  9681	On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,
  9682	extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of
  9683	the first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its
  9684	temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not
  9685	one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that
  9686	"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great
  9687	Britain upon constitutional principles to independence." At the same
  9688	time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,
  9689	declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
  9690	king's government to the Congress' tyranny." In an address to the king
  9691	in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that "the number
  9692	of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
  9693	enlisted by Congress to oppose them."
  9694	
  9695	=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
  9696	more than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according
  9697	to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
  9698	virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and
  9699	professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." The act
  9700	of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
  9701	"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
  9702	New England," more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard
  9703	College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that
  9704	the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
  9705	clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought
  9706	against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
  9707	for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.
  9708	
  9709	=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined
  9710	the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
  9711	cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
  9712	editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared
  9713	that the members of Congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
  9714	bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc." The people and their
  9715	leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
  9716	dregs of mankind." The generals in the army they sneered at as "men of
  9717	rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress."
  9718	
  9719	=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,
  9720	patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
  9721	opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat
  9722	the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
  9723	war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the
  9724	winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a
  9725	disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in
  9726	1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
  9727	beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost
  9728	too great for the stoutest patriots.
  9729	
  9730	Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs
  9731	of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,
  9732	forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,
  9733	Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated
  9734	the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
  9735	and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,
  9736	battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress
  9737	afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
  9738	"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously inquired John
  9739	Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
  9740	every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten
  9741	every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God
  9742	most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray
  9743	for the American army."
  9744	
  9745	Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of
  9746	Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New
  9747	Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the
  9748	army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great
  9749	appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
  9750	of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This
  9751	tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. "These are the
  9752	times that try men's souls," he opened. "The summer soldier and the
  9753	sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
  9754	country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
  9755	and women." Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every
  9756	one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." He
  9757	deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He
  9758	refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster
  9759	and he promised victory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
  9760	concluded, "we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and
  9761	submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
  9762	depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without
  9763	hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it." His ringing call to
  9764	arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
  9765	over.
  9766	
  9767	
  9768	MILITARY AFFAIRS
  9769	
  9770	=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of
  9771	Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of
  9772	Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
  9773	phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in
  9774	1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first
  9775	phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding
  9776	features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,
  9777	the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through
  9778	New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the
  9779	British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his
  9780	capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American
  9781	forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.
  9782	
  9783	The final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with
  9784	France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,
  9785	the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events
  9786	were the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of
  9787	Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying
  9788	American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the
  9789	West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois
  9790	country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
  9791	country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second
  9792	period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,
  9793	conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized
  9794	Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under
  9795	Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at
  9796	Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis
  9797	began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into
  9798	North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the
  9799	coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and
  9800	fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the
  9801	sea and the combined French and American forces on land.
  9802	
  9803	=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of
  9804	the war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from
  9805	Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was
  9806	nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
  9807	the British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly
  9808	falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The
  9809	sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between
  9810	points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of
  9811	wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early
  9812	forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end
  9813	of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
  9814	the approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both
  9815	Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest
  9816	of cities.
  9817	
  9818	Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
  9819	portion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the
  9820	coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on
  9821	the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact
  9822	gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far
  9823	from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced
  9824	to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
  9825	base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they
  9826	were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
  9827	and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far
  9828	in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
  9829	Sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their
  9830	armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the
  9831	Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
  9832	blow.
  9833	
  9834	=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting
  9835	off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
  9836	United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
  9837	not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though
  9838	somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a
  9839	nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were
  9840	cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.
  9841	
  9842	Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry
  9843	materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American
  9844	seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of
  9845	British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
  9846	seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the
  9847	hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply
  9848	ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the
  9849	French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to
  9850	reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
  9851	possibilities of a maritime disaster.
  9852	
  9853	=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is
  9854	difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
  9855	There is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience
  9856	in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the
  9857	French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
  9858	disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,
  9859	society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to
  9860	overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York
  9861	and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John
  9862	Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from
  9863	Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and
  9864	Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
  9865	after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,
  9866	he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who
  9867	directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
  9868	had "learned his trade on the continent," and was regarded as a man of
  9869	discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose
  9870	achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
  9871	Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted
  9872	talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
  9873	India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,
  9874	they all had training and experience to guide them.
  9875	
  9876	[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]
  9877	
  9878	The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been
  9879	interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
  9880	during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He
  9881	had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of
  9882	the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He
  9883	was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
  9884	depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, "what held
  9885	the patriot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John
  9886	Marshall_. Then he answers: "George Washington and he alone. Had he
  9887	died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....
  9888	Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the
  9889	government. Washington was the Revolution." The weakness of Congress in
  9890	furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
  9891	ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him
  9892	such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the
  9893	treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
  9894	breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did
  9895	not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
  9896	to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was
  9897	immeasurable.
  9898	
  9899	Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have
  9900	been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
  9901	unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book
  9902	seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called
  9903	him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
  9904	because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at
  9905	Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven
  9906	Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.
  9907	The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
  9908	defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael
  9909	Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience
  9910	who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
  9911	took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South
  9912	Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
  9913	with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the
  9914	heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen
  9915	some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military
  9916	knowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was
  9917	negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New
  9918	Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
  9919	lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a
  9920	Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
  9921	read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for
  9922	service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and
  9923	it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and
  9924	Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
  9925	troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European
  9926	experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of
  9927	the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
  9928	during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
  9929	balance.
  9930	
  9931	=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added
  9932	military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
  9933	the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined
  9934	Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
  9935	men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
  9936	soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from
  9937	Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
  9938	as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.
  9939	Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
  9940	several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the
  9941	war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the
  9942	siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American
  9943	war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these
  9944	distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American
  9945	revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which
  9946	fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
  9947	power of the first rank.
  9948	
  9949	=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their
  9950	annals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who
  9951	were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up
  9952	by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought
  9953	outright by King George presented few problems of management to the
  9954	British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and
  9955	enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
  9956	of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George
  9957	fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
  9958	demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,
  9959	some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
  9960	their own kin; but they obeyed orders.
  9961	
  9962	The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
  9963	determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in
  9964	discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke
  9965	in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no
  9966	continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of
  9967	them experienced in fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
  9968	sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,
  9969	unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
  9970	imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually
  9971	leaving the service just at the most critical moments. "The militia,"
  9972	lamented Washington, "come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
  9973	where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
  9974	last at a critical moment."
  9975	
  9976	Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of
  9977	regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
  9978	some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,
  9979	the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that
  9980	reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
  9981	bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this
  9982	scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the
  9983	soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the
  9984	conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
  9985	meeting British regulars on equal terms.
  9986	
  9987	Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
  9988	effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
  9989	time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
  9990	forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did
  9991	nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,
  9992	and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White
  9993	Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen
  9994	overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.
  9995	"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier," wrote
  9996	Washington, "requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and
  9997	undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
  9998	did and perhaps never will happen."
  9999	
 10000	=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For
 10001	one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British
 10002	generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
 10003	large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
 10004	paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American
 10005	army. "Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
 10006	us," solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that
 10007	this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The
 10008	ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
 10009	loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
 10010	war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
 10011	better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
 10012	healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were
 10013	thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things
 10014	about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were
 10015	embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage
 10016	with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The
 10017	long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
 10018	warships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply
 10019	boats.
 10020	
 10021	The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
 10022	outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and
 10023	Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which
 10024	could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
 10025	the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.
 10026	They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the
 10027	scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a
 10028	price which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there
 10029	were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.
 10030	
 10031	=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent
 10032	to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of
 10033	opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
 10034	Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
 10035	espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James
 10036	Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case
 10037	upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the
 10038	leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing
 10039	about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing
 10040	letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."
 10041	
 10042	When the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In
 10043	sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a
 10044	tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
 10045	Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
 10046	service in the "second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed the
 10047	plantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the
 10048	rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her
 10049	husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
 10050	Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set
 10051	the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
 10052	near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling
 10053	powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
 10054	lives.
 10055	
 10056	In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested
 10057	crops without enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerettes" and they
 10058	canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their
 10059	labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: "Immediately on being cut
 10060	off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their
 10061	own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
 10062	They thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
 10063	labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
 10064	themselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry
 10065	and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,
 10066	evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
 10067	service."
 10068	
 10069	For their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more
 10070	than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even
 10071	as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid
 10072	tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
 10073	given to the cause of independence.
 10074	
 10075	
 10076	THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION
 10077	
 10078	When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in
 10079	America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was
 10080	in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority
 10081	to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
 10082	provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
 10083	finance the war. "Do you think," boldly inquired one of the delegates,
 10084	"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
 10085	to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will
 10086	pay for the whole?"
 10087	
 10088	=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political
 10089	economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
 10090	credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
 10091	populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about
 10092	$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
 10093	states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came
 10094	interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions
 10095	were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In
 10096	desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The
 10097	property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
 10098	$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
 10099	raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
 10100	with their own affairs, gave little heed.
 10101	
 10102	=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
 10103	rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
 10104	only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by
 10105	Congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
 10106	value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.
 10107	Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
 10108	republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
 10109	securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley
 10110	Forge. "Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling," exclaimed
 10111	Washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
 10112	virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
 10113	... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
 10114	the enemy."
 10115	
 10116	=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the
 10117	war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant
 10118	of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,
 10119	Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
 10120	money for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of
 10121	half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,
 10122	if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia
 10123	merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the "patriot
 10124	financier" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
 10125	the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own
 10126	funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the
 10127	handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to
 10128	distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as
 10129	well as financial talents.
 10130	
 10131	[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]
 10132	
 10133	Women organized "drives" for money, contributed their plate and their
 10134	jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
 10135	return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
 10136	yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
 10137	the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,
 10138	borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress
 10139	staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
 10140	next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
 10141	kindly fate.
 10142	
 10143	
 10144	THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION
 10145	
 10146	When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
 10147	their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
 10148	supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women
 10149	who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
 10150	achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was
 10151	keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were
 10152	fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of
 10153	power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their
 10154	rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening
 10155	relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
 10156	even military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,
 10157	they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
 10158	1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.
 10159	
 10160	=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a
 10161	friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a
 10162	commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the
 10163	"first American diplomat." Later in the year a form of treaty to be
 10164	presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and
 10165	Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of "His
 10166	Most Christian Majesty the King of France." John Jay of New York was
 10167	chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the
 10168	same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
 10169	Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two
 10170	fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
 10171	experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure." Frederick the Great,
 10172	king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for
 10173	Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,
 10174	he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.
 10175	
 10176	=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
 10177	was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,
 10178	although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis
 10179	XVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any
 10180	American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the
 10181	opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her
 10182	colonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and
 10183	"reduce the power and greatness of England"--the empire that in 1763 had
 10184	forced upon her a humiliating peace "at the price of our possessions,
 10185	of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,
 10186	Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
 10187	gaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,
 10188	Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
 10189	popular plays, "Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." These two men had
 10190	already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared
 10191	on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential
 10192	arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to
 10193	the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were
 10194	officially refused by the French government.
 10195	
 10196	=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only
 10197	in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,
 10198	however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
 10199	"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet." He was known among
 10200	men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of
 10201	extraordinary ability. His "Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
 10202	into French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
 10203	kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
 10204	peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in
 10205	his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a
 10206	revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
 10207	republican."
 10208	
 10209	For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England
 10210	resented the presence of this "traitor" in Paris, and Louis had to be
 10211	cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
 10212	disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris
 10213	was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
 10214	exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with
 10215	Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,
 10216	the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement
 10217	to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and
 10218	Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson
 10219	and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British
 10220	troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,
 10221	cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the
 10222	king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in
 10223	from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
 10224	parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,
 10225	1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to
 10226	receive the honor.
 10227	
 10228	=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,
 10229	placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
 10230	reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends
 10231	sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once
 10232	the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with
 10233	such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and
 10234	his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
 10235	Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
 10236	in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized
 10237	by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.
 10238	Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally
 10239	declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought
 10240	one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
 10241	Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt
 10242	had erected and that George III was pulling down.
 10243	
 10244	=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering
 10245	the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and
 10246	hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the
 10247	concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of
 10248	armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high
 10249	seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and
 10250	America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England
 10251	was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit
 10252	of independence was flaming up.
 10253	
 10254	=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be
 10255	joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North
 10256	proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn
 10257	enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
 10258	of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
 10259	the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.
 10260	A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws
 10261	suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the
 10262	opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events
 10263	had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British
 10264	commissioners and diplomats.
 10265	
 10266	=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,
 10267	large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable
 10268	body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
 10269	help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British
 10270	evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
 10271	Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They
 10272	inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable
 10273	conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
 10274	Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of
 10275	Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.
 10276	
 10277	The full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when
 10278	Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by
 10279	French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British
 10280	to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.
 10281	It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
 10282	without French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British
 10283	dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that
 10284	caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
 10285	all over!" What might have been done without the French alliance lies
 10286	hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French
 10287	soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the
 10288	earth. "All the world agree," exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to
 10289	General Washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
 10290	better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
 10291	the latest posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
 10292	reward.
 10293	
 10294	
 10295	PEACE AT LAST
 10296	
 10297	=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to
 10298	the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to
 10299	remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home
 10300	faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were
 10301	vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
 10302	the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
 10303	and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
 10304	American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered
 10305	against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.
 10306	William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American
 10307	independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
 10308	American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against
 10309	every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
 10310	giving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather
 10311	than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous
 10312	sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of
 10313	statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David
 10314	Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author
 10315	of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in
 10316	seeing it through.
 10317	
 10318	Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army
 10319	of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
 10320	their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,
 10321	was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
 10322	before printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in
 10323	time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman
 10324	Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
 10325	lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his
 10326	friends to ridicule him in these lines:
 10327	
 10328	    "King George, in a fright
 10329	     Lest Gibbon should write
 10330	       The story of England's disgrace,
 10331	     Thought no way so sure
 10332	     His pen to secure
 10333	       As to give the historian a place."
 10334	
 10335	=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
 10336	of the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that
 10337	conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace
 10338	which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.
 10339	Every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
 10340	arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
 10341	English burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses
 10342	were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single
 10343	outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due
 10344	British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an
 10345	indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French
 10346	had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in
 10347	December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
 10348	peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on
 10349	February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the
 10350	throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,
 10351	and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North
 10352	gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:
 10353	"Necessity made me yield."
 10354	
 10355	In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that
 10356	it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This
 10357	was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United
 10358	States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
 10359	both nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to
 10360	some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American
 10361	commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without
 10362	consulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace
 10363	draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes
 10364	reproached him, Franklin replied that they "had been guilty of
 10365	neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
 10366	would not be ruined by a single indiscretion."
 10367	
 10368	=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783
 10369	was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the
 10370	United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries
 10371	extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes
 10372	to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies
 10373	intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.
 10374	Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France
 10375	gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled
 10376	and the colonies independent.
 10377	
 10378	The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called
 10379	forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way
 10380	for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the
 10381	same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. "This federal
 10382	republic is born a pigmy," wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal
 10383	master. "A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus
 10384	formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility
 10385	for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the
 10386	advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
 10387	from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the
 10388	tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

 10392	
 10393	SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD
 10394	
 10395	The independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European
 10396	statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
 10397	power; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the
 10398	American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There
 10399	were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed
 10400	with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the
 10401	exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on
 10402	the whole, the relations between America and the mother country were
 10403	more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which
 10404	closed in 1688.
 10405	
 10406	The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was
 10407	the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.
 10408	Three years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,
 10409	proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
 10410	predecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed
 10411	things to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would
 10412	be king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought
 10413	to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering
 10414	under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
 10415	in defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
 10416	to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
 10417	the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into
 10418	prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and
 10419	controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,
 10420	the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and
 10421	statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set
 10422	out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
 10423	their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This
 10424	action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
 10425	Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
 10426	grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
 10427	sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.
 10428	
 10429	Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed
 10430	the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of
 10431	interference. Interference again called forth American protests.
 10432	Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent
 10433	over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.
 10434	Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and
 10435	seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.
 10436	The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An
 10437	unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
 10438	spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:
 10439	"The Americans are rebels!"
 10440	
 10441	The die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made
 10442	commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
 10443	volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
 10444	Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced
 10445	France to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,
 10446	Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of
 10447	peace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.
 10448	The new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
 10449	Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the
 10450	sovereign powers of the earth.
 10451	
 10452	In the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were
 10453	equally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven
 10454	from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.
 10455	All the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan
 10456	of government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
 10457	Articles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.
 10458	Thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
 10459	world had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down
 10460	and be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon
 10461	the answer.

 10563	
 10564	THE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
 10565	
 10566	
 10567	THE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA
 10568	
 10569	The rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed
 10570	by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
 10571	people," was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The
 10572	majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
 10573	possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those
 10574	Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that
 10575	the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
 10576	constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
 10577	could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All
 10578	around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
 10579	immediate future.
 10580	
 10581	=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under
 10582	the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
 10583	necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
 10584	The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to
 10585	seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
 10586	paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one
 10587	vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no
 10588	president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a
 10589	committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body
 10590	when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved
 10591	a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and
 10592	states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
 10593	they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,
 10594	military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could
 10595	authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
 10596	of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the
 10597	establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
 10598	their respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring
 10599	any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It
 10600	could act only through the medium of the state governments.
 10601	
 10602	=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,
 10603	the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was
 10604	still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
 10605	principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of
 10606	their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The
 10607	current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was
 10608	not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
 10609	the transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter
 10610	chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere
 10611	trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression
 10612	of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: "not worth a
 10613	Continental." To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
 10614	new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in
 10615	circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the
 10616	public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
 10617	clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The
 10618	entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the
 10619	Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,
 10620	was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.
 10621	Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
 10622	erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the
 10623	currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
 10624	as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering
 10625	the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which
 10626	nothing but a national system of courts could cure.
 10627	
 10628	=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the
 10629	laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
 10630	Congress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon
 10631	the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
 10632	treated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
 10633	futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and
 10634	many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
 10635	Again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
 10636	of business.
 10637	
 10638	=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to
 10639	pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as
 10640	many difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with
 10641	revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
 10642	population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
 10643	fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of
 10644	several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
 10645	legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in
 10646	value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
 10647	old accounts.
 10648	
 10649	In every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.
 10650	Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
 10651	third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
 10652	canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural
 10653	consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
 10654	states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in
 10655	payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily
 10656	in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against
 10657	creditors.
 10658	
 10659	So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in
 10660	1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
 10661	taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an
 10662	armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the
 10663	leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
 10664	organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.
 10665	Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
 10666	foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the
 10667	lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the
 10668	senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
 10669	towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and
 10670	against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized
 10671	the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of
 10672	justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,
 10673	sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
 10674	republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to
 10675	quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state
 10676	government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
 10677	so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the
 10678	legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
 10679	were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance
 10680	for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
 10681	emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.
 10682	
 10683	=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,
 10684	watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that
 10685	the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
 10686	careening into anarchy. "The facts of our peace and independence," wrote
 10687	a friend of Washington, "do not at present wear so promising an
 10688	appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
 10689	jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
 10690	confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
 10691	think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
 10692	which we have contended."
 10693	
 10694	Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's
 10695	rebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man that there should
 10696	be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the
 10697	other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
 10698	under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
 10699	now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them." The same year he
 10700	burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "I am
 10701	told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
 10702	without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is
 10703	often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
 10704	triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for
 10705	the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
 10706	ourselves!"
 10707	
 10708	=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to
 10709	the events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many
 10710	efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,
 10711	industries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the
 10712	treaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile
 10713	were its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the
 10714	Articles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on
 10715	imports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years
 10716	later the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of
 10717	duties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and
 10718	applied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,
 10719	designed to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress
 10720	made a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been
 10721	so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further
 10722	reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and
 10723	dangerous.
 10724	
 10725	
 10726	THE CALLING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
 10727	
 10728	=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the
 10729	Congress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that
 10730	body, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the
 10731	youthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so
 10732	widely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of
 10733	drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With
 10734	tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.
 10735	Washington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular
 10736	letter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short
 10737	unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power "to regulate and
 10738	govern the general concerns of the confederated republic." The governor
 10739	of Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,
 10740	suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a
 10741	national convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The
 10742	legislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.
 10743	
 10744	[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
 10745	
 10746	=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The
 10747	Virginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a
 10748	conference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and
 10749	commerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only
 10750	five states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders
 10751	were deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from
 10752	New York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of
 10753	a resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another
 10754	convention, to meet at Philadelphia.
 10755	
 10756	=A National Convention Called (1787).=--The Congress, as tardy as ever,
 10757	at last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic
 10758	changes, however, it restricted the convention to "the sole and express
 10759	purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." Jealous of its own
 10760	powers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the
 10761	Congress and the states for their approval.
 10762	
 10763	Every state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.
 10764	Indeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,
 10765	had already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the
 10766	formal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,
 10767	legislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the
 10768	long-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in
 10769	Philadelphia.
 10770	
 10771	=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable
 10772	convention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged
 10773	to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field
 10774	of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in
 10775	Washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in
 10776	Franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;
 10777	finance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of
 10778	Pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the
 10779	"father of the Constitution." They were not theorists but practical men,
 10780	rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the
 10781	springs of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act
 10782	Congress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,
 10783	and John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the
 10784	Declaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,
 10785	Wythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,
 10786	George Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at
 10787	some time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members
 10788	of that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and
 10789	Charles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of
 10790	the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.
 10791	"The convention as a whole," according to the historian Hildreth,
 10792	"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and
 10793	especially the conservative sentiment of the country."
 10794	
 10795	
 10796	THE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION
 10797	
 10798	=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine
 10799	in number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new
 10800	system of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on
 10801	states equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper
 10802	foundation of population? (3) What direct share shall the people have in
 10803	the election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications
 10804	for the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the
 10805	commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the
 10806	essential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new
 10807	government? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the
 10808	state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights
 10809	such as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the
 10810	states be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and
 10811	amendment of the Constitution?
 10812	
 10813	=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first
 10814	problem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William
 10815	Paterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the
 10816	Articles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be
 10817	put in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the
 10818	call issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which
 10819	specifically stated that they were assembled for "the sole and express
 10820	purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." They cited also
 10821	their instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them
 10822	to "revise and amend" the existing scheme of government, not to make a
 10823	revolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the
 10824	Congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they
 10825	argued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.
 10826	
 10827	To their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: "When the salvation
 10828	of the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to
 10829	propose what we find necessary." Hamilton, reminding the delegates that
 10830	their work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said
 10831	that on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue
 10832	clear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist
 10833	and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, "laying its
 10834	foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form"
 10835	as to the delegates seemed "most likely to affect their safety and
 10836	happiness."
 10837	
 10838	=A Government Founded on States or on People?--The
 10839	Compromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a
 10840	mere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states
 10841	redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The
 10842	signal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given
 10843	early in the sessions when Randolph presented "the Virginia plan." He
 10844	proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the
 10845	members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to
 10846	their wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.
 10847	This plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly
 10848	avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As
 10849	an alternative, he presented "the New Jersey plan" calling for a
 10850	national legislature of one house representing states as such, not
 10851	wealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,
 10852	would have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more
 10853	populous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It
 10854	was absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same
 10855	weight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. "The
 10856	gentleman from New Jersey," he said, "is candid. He declares his opinion
 10857	boldly.... I will be equally candid.... I will never confederate on his
 10858	principles." So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting
 10859	sessions.
 10860	
 10861	Greek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the
 10862	verge of dissolution, "scarce held together by the strength of a hair,"
 10863	as one of the delegates remarked. A crash was averted only by a
 10864	compromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the
 10865	Articles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the
 10866	Senate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for
 10867	each state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the
 10868	House of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was
 10869	agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the
 10870	states on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.
 10871	
 10872	=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal
 10873	officers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate
 10874	which revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the
 10875	people to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch
 10876	of the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer
 10877	were there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or
 10878	two even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy
 10879	were stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: "All the evils we experience
 10880	flow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are
 10881	the dupes of pretended patriots.... I have been too republican
 10882	heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling
 10883	spirit." To the "democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,"
 10884	Randolph sought to oppose a "firm senate." To check the excesses of
 10885	popular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no
 10886	one should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high
 10887	property qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and
 10888	judges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such
 10889	"high-toned notions of government." Franklin and Wilson, both from
 10890	Pennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like
 10891	Madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on
 10892	the broad foundation of the people.
 10893	
 10894	Out of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House
 10895	of Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the
 10896	voters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state
 10897	legislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the
 10898	legislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the
 10899	federal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.
 10900	
 10901	=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp
 10902	but brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be
 10903	permitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which
 10904	had made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.
 10905	After the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property
 10906	limitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives
 10907	should be elected by voters having the "qualifications requisite for
 10908	electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature." Thus
 10909	they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.
 10910	
 10911	=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the
 10912	debates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that
 10913	the real division in the convention was not between the large and the
 10914	small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and
 10915	the commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a
 10916	century "the irrepressible conflict." The planting states had neither
 10917	the free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,
 10918	counting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.
 10919	Dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,
 10920	and other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose
 10921	restraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were
 10922	afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.
 10923	
 10924	_Representation and Taxation._--The Southern members of the convention
 10925	were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest
 10926	possible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain
 10927	the taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these
 10928	ends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning
 10929	representatives among the states according to their respective
 10930	populations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be
 10931	apportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to
 10932	the number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the
 10933	Northern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise
 10934	proved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but
 10935	three-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation
 10936	and direct taxation.
 10937	
 10938	_Commerce and the Slave Trade._--Southern interests were also involved
 10939	in the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate
 10940	and foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was
 10941	essential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it
 10942	would enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break
 10943	down, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against
 10944	American commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because
 10945	tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of
 10946	plantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the
 10947	carrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of
 10948	slaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately
 10949	prohibited altogether.
 10950	
 10951	The result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits
 10952	of slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that
 10953	subject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of
 10954	heaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a
 10955	slaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: "Slavery
 10956	discourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed
 10957	by slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen
 10958	and enrich a country."
 10959	
 10960	The system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South
 10961	Carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor
 10962	and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous
 10963	importation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that
 10964	the convention should not meddle with slavery. "The morality or wisdom
 10965	of slavery," he said, "are considerations belonging to the states. What
 10966	enriches a part enriches the whole." To the future he turned an
 10967	untroubled face: "As population increases, poor laborers will be so
 10968	plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck
 10969	in our country." Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with
 10970	slaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was
 10971	adamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not
 10972	federate.
 10973	
 10974	So it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by
 10975	majority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before
 10976	the lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10
 10977	a head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign
 10978	trade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be
 10979	necessary in the ratification of treaties. A further concession to the
 10980	South was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a
 10981	provision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about
 10982	as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.
 10983	
 10984	=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of
 10985	government and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the
 10986	convention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of
 10987	debate, only to be revoked and taken again.
 10988	
 10989	_The Executive._--There was general agreement that there should be an
 10990	executive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and
 10991	treaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the
 10992	executive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called
 10993	for a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that
 10994	the executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state
 10995	whether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter
 10996	the convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed
 10997	on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the
 10998	state legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to
 10999	impeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army
 11000	and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.
 11001	
 11002	_The Legislative Branch--Congress._--After the convention had made the
 11003	great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving
 11004	representation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,
 11005	the question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House
 11006	of Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be
 11007	elected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the
 11008	proposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the "turbulence" of
 11009	the lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this
 11010	purpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly
 11011	by the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their
 11012	election one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term
 11013	was fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In
 11014	the third place, provision was made for continuity by having only
 11015	one-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in
 11016	service. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty
 11017	years old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.
 11018	
 11019	_The Judiciary._--The need for federal courts to carry out the law was
 11020	hardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation
 11021	was, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold
 11022	states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the
 11023	union. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were
 11024	extremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
 11025	the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
 11026	traditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
 11027	against Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what
 11028	consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges
 11029	independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.
 11030	Reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at
 11031	first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state
 11032	courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might
 11033	deem necessary.
 11034	
 11035	_The System of Checks and Balances._--It is thus apparent that the
 11036	framers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged
 11037	for a distribution of power among three branches, executive,
 11038	legislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,
 11039	for the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in
 11040	different ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the
 11041	President through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. "The
 11042	accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the
 11043	same hands," wrote Madison, "whether of one, a few, or many, and whether
 11044	hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the
 11045	very definition of tyranny." The devices which the convention adopted to
 11046	prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious
 11047	and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.
 11048	
 11049	The legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be
 11050	apportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to
 11051	serve for different terms. A veto on all its acts was vested in a
 11052	President elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either
 11053	branch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to
 11054	removal only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had
 11055	run the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to
 11056	interpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the
 11057	President with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it
 11058	was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of
 11059	all branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton
 11060	remarked, the friends of good government considered "every institution
 11061	calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in
 11062	the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more
 11063	likely to do good than harm."
 11064	
 11065	=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers
 11066	to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a
 11067	serious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with
 11068	those from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers
 11069	should be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of
 11070	Confederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan
 11071	recognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,
 11072	even proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering
 11073	all national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of
 11074	nationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and
 11075	finally carried the day.
 11076	
 11077	_Taxation and Commerce._--There were none bold enough to dissent from
 11078	the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses
 11079	and discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the
 11080	apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was
 11081	an easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and
 11082	collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national
 11083	government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy
 11084	legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There
 11085	were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state
 11086	tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the
 11087	fears of the planting states were allayed and the "bargain" over the
 11088	importation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the
 11089	power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.
 11090	
 11091	_National Defense._--The necessity for national defense was realized,
 11092	though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The
 11093	old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures
 11094	was completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority
 11095	over citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to
 11096	raise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia
 11097	when desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army
 11098	and call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis
 11099	was thought to require it.
 11100	
 11101	_The "Necessary and Proper" Clause._--To the specified power vested in
 11102	Congress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national
 11103	government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws
 11104	"necessary and proper" for carrying into effect any and all of the
 11105	enumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief
 11106	Justice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the
 11107	requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place
 11108	among the mighty nations of the earth.
 11109	
 11110	=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with
 11111	large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its
 11112	very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
 11113	legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.
 11114	In every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was
 11115	a party of men who had "marked out for themselves a more indulgent
 11116	course. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their
 11117	efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful
 11118	compliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which
 11119	the people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the
 11120	administration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of
 11121	debts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes."
 11122	
 11123	The legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper
 11124	money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.
 11125	The convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state
 11126	should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
 11127	tender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws
 11128	allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or
 11129	personal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college
 11130	and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they
 11131	had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The
 11132	convention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding
 11133	states "to impair the obligation of contracts." The more venturous of
 11134	the radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against
 11135	the authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief
 11136	sentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be
 11137	equipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic
 11138	insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not
 11139	in session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the
 11140	restrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal
 11141	Constitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,
 11142	to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive
 11143	against violations on the part of any state authorities.
 11144	
 11145	=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of
 11146	government had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been
 11147	enumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into
 11148	the bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the
 11149	Constitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to
 11150	put it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?
 11151	
 11152	On the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting
 11153	seemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.
 11154	They provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption
 11155	in Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to
 11156	this provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated
 11157	that all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for
 11158	adoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document
 11159	thereafter to the states for their review.
 11160	
 11161	To have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the
 11162	purposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures
 11163	were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous
 11164	ratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore
 11165	the delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress
 11166	with the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to
 11167	the state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the
 11168	special object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.
 11169	It was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than
 11170	the state legislatures.
 11171	
 11172	The convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the
 11173	number of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts
 11174	to change the Articles had failed because amendment required the
 11175	approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant
 11176	member of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was
 11177	undoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in
 11178	framing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast
 11179	aside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required
 11180	unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed
 11181	that the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine
 11182	states.
 11183	
 11184	In providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the
 11185	convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and
 11186	decided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both
 11187	houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This
 11188	change was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in
 11189	the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve
 11190	them itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led
 11191	from a league of states to a nation.
 11192	
 11193	
 11194	THE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION
 11195	
 11196	On September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in
 11197	clear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was
 11198	adopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret
 11199	session, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the
 11200	finished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to
 11201	the people.
 11202	
 11203	=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the
 11204	Constitution. "Fraudulent usurpation!" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused
 11205	to sign it. "A monster" out of the "thick veil of secrecy," declaimed a
 11206	Pennsylvania newspaper. "An iron-handed despotism will be the result,"
 11207	protested a third. "We, 'the low-born,'" sarcastically wrote a fourth,
 11208	"will now admit the 'six hundred well-born' immediately to establish
 11209	this most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution." The
 11210	President will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as
 11211	Parliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights
 11212	of the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost
 11213	in the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the
 11214	protests against ratification.
 11215	
 11216	[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT OF _The Federalist_]
 11217	
 11218	=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,
 11219	Hamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the
 11220	Constitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and
 11221	expounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause
 11222	and provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected
 11223	and published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest
 11224	textbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its
 11225	place, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government
 11226	ever written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were
 11227	no less earnest in their support of ratification. In private
 11228	correspondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,
 11229	they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a
 11230	Constitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the
 11231	only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and
 11232	weakness abroad.
 11233	
 11234	[Illustration: CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION]
 11235	
 11236	=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,
 11237	1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New
 11238	Jersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,
 11239	contest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came
 11240	the battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by
 11241	the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that
 11242	Maryland and South Carolina were "under the new roof." On June 21, New
 11243	Hampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the
 11244	Constitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable
 11245	decision in Massachusetts. Swift couriers were sent to carry the news to
 11246	New York and Virginia, where the question of ratification was still
 11247	undecided. Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw
 11248	fit to join or not.
 11249	
 11250	Meanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had
 11251	given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat
 11252	of anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the
 11253	convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events
 11254	finally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good
 11255	judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority
 11256	of thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.
 11257	
 11258	The great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and
 11259	Rhode Island, had ratified. "The sloop Anarchy," wrote an ebullient
 11260	journalist, "when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks."
 11261	
 11262	=The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to
 11263	fill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly
 11264	in favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the
 11265	importunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public
 11266	service. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at Federal Hall
 11267	in New York City. "Long live George Washington, President of the United
 11268	States!" cried Chancellor Livingston as soon as the General had kissed
 11269	the Bible. The cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back.
 11270	A new experiment in popular government was launched.

 11357	THE MEN AND MEASURES OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT
 11358	
 11359	=Friends of the Constitution in Power.=--In the first Congress that
 11360	assembled after the adoption of the Constitution, there were eleven
 11361	Senators, led by Robert Morris, the financier, who had been delegates to
 11362	the national convention. Several members of the House of
 11363	Representatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia
 11364	in 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new
 11365	system of government still further by a judicious selection of
 11366	officials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,
 11367	who had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the
 11368	War Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise
 11369	conspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal
 11370	judiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,
 11371	down to the justices of the district courts, had favored the
 11372	ratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as
 11373	members of the national convention that framed the document or of the
 11374	state ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new
 11375	government, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a
 11376	doubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for
 11377	and against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting
 11378	as the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.
 11379	
 11380	=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the
 11381	plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil
 11382	which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. "The
 11383	interesting nature of the question," wrote John Marshall, "the equality
 11384	of the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a
 11385	necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to
 11386	fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of
 11387	government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted." The
 11388	leaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state
 11389	of the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside
 11390	of the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had
 11391	been approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New
 11392	York. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,
 11393	in yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number
 11394	of amendments for immediate submission to the states.
 11395	
 11396	=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,
 11397	Madison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments
 11398	to the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a
 11399	part of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other
 11400	things, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of
 11401	religion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right
 11402	of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a
 11403	redress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and
 11404	trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious
 11405	crimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be
 11406	invaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly
 11407	provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the
 11408	Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
 11409	states respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh
 11410	amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a
 11411	heated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a
 11412	citizen to bring a suit against "the sovereign state" of Georgia. The
 11413	new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal
 11414	judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by
 11415	a citizen.
 11416	
 11417	=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,
 11418	paid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At
 11419	the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public
 11420	debt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on
 11421	Public Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and
 11422	greatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines
 11423	of his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all
 11424	the old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay
 11425	which had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the
 11426	Revolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one
 11427	consolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the
 11428	holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at
 11429	fixed rates. This process was called "funding the debt." Such a
 11430	provision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would
 11431	satisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and
 11432	furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit
 11433	and capital.
 11434	
 11435	=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the
 11436	obligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.
 11437	These debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be
 11438	"assumed" by the United States government and placed on the same secure
 11439	foundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely
 11440	on grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to
 11441	the new national government by making all public creditors, men of
 11442	substance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than
 11443	the state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.
 11444	
 11445	=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,
 11446	assumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions
 11447	of dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
 11448	the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
 11449	support of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary
 11450	army was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a
 11451	very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
 11452	figures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it
 11453	had been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a
 11454	discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
 11455	purchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
 11456	had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their
 11457	outlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that
 11458	the government should "scale the debt" by redeeming, not at full value
 11459	but at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the
 11460	proposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the
 11461	government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,
 11462	although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate
 11463	of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on
 11464	another part.
 11465	
 11466	=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in
 11467	securing the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the
 11468	national debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,
 11469	however, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern
 11470	members of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,
 11471	without any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of
 11472	Northern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had
 11473	bought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.
 11474	New England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;
 11475	several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a
 11476	dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was
 11477	added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national
 11478	capital, then temporarily at New York City.
 11479	
 11480	[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES BANK AT PHILADELPHIA]
 11481	
 11482	A deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,
 11483	threatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and
 11484	Hamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the
 11485	contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of
 11486	the Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management
 11487	at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once
 11488	more, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union
 11489	saved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of
 11490	votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough
 11491	Southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority
 11492	was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the
 11493	Potomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to
 11494	satisfy Pennsylvania members.
 11495	
 11496	=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and
 11497	assumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great
 11498	United States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered
 11499	by Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000
 11500	(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in
 11501	specie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.
 11502	Many advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from
 11503	this institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,
 11504	thus enhancing public credit. A national currency would be created of
 11505	uniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the
 11506	bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to
 11507	commercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue
 11508	of bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry
 11509	would be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson
 11510	hotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power
 11511	whatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.
 11512	Hamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all
 11513	opinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill
 11514	establishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years
 11515	became a law.
 11516	
 11517	=The Protective Tariff.=--A third part of Hamilton's program was the
 11518	protection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though
 11519	designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in
 11520	favor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the
 11521	subject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to
 11522	prepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a
 11523	delay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another
 11524	state paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of
 11525	understanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton
 11526	based his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective
 11527	tariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home
 11528	market for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United
 11529	States independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double
 11530	its security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and
 11531	children, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise
 11532	idle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North
 11533	and South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political
 11534	ties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore
 11535	the impress of these arguments.
 11536	
 11537	
 11538	THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES
 11539	
 11540	=Dissensions over Hamilton's Measures.=--Hamilton's plans, touching
 11541	deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the
 11542	states, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his
 11543	critics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state
 11544	debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had
 11545	no constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank
 11546	merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at
 11547	a high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for
 11548	the benefit of manufacturers.
 11549	
 11550	Hamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and
 11551	straightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding
 11552	of the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the
 11553	restoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it
 11554	was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The
 11555	Constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of
 11556	national needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely
 11557	needed to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and
 11558	planters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing
 11559	opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of
 11560	such wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were
 11561	bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,
 11562	credit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding
 11563	the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures
 11564	adopted under his administration.
 11565	
 11566	=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of
 11567	opinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:
 11568	Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter
 11569	by Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,
 11570	Providence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the
 11571	manufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who
 11572	were eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the
 11573	Anti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared
 11574	the growth of what they called "a money power" and planters in all
 11575	sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing
 11576	interests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,
 11577	finally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,
 11578	and the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in
 11579	bitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which
 11580	Hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the
 11581	constant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the
 11582	contestants.
 11583	
 11584	=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not
 11585	gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to
 11586	Jefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton's measures he had approved,
 11587	declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their
 11588	significance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More
 11589	than once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each
 11590	other at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified
 11591	pleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In
 11592	1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and
 11593	retired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and
 11594	negotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.
 11595	
 11596	Shy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of
 11597	public debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,
 11598	Jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political
 11599	contest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was
 11600	also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of
 11601	Hamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, "high-toned"
 11602	government, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked
 11603	upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and
 11604	openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular
 11605	uprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. "Your people is a great
 11606	beast," he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in
 11607	the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.
 11608	
 11609	On economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also
 11610	hopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired
 11611	to see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was
 11612	equally set against this course for his country. He feared the
 11613	accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.
 11614	The mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;
 11615	artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;
 11616	workshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their
 11617	insidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a
 11618	republic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of
 11619	independence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land
 11620	they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their
 11621	hands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of
 11622	human nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those
 11623	measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of
 11624	persons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the
 11625	champion of the individual against the interference of the government,
 11626	and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and
 11627	freedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious
 11628	spirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.
 11629	
 11630	=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists
 11631	was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The
 11632	occasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton's measures, a law
 11633	laying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing
 11634	the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so
 11635	happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the
 11636	country was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their
 11637	own stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now
 11638	come into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the
 11639	tax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against
 11640	the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western
 11641	districts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to
 11642	pay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses
 11643	of the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had
 11644	mobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in
 11645	a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called
 11646	out the troops to suppress "the Whisky Rebellion." Then the movement
 11647	collapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up
 11648	in the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the
 11649	disaffected regions.
 11650	
 11651	
 11652	FOREIGN INFLUENCES AND DOMESTIC POLITICS
 11653	
 11654	=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was
 11655	distracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the
 11656	epoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the
 11657	Old World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.
 11658	The first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,
 11659	a few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis
 11660	XVI, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced
 11661	to resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for
 11662	the first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the
 11663	national parliament, the "Estates General," composed of representatives
 11664	of the "three estates"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting
 11665	under powerful leaders, the commoners, or "third estate," swept aside
 11666	the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national
 11667	assembly. This stirred the country to its depths.
 11668	
 11669	[Illustration: _From an old print_
 11670	
 11671	LOUIS XVI IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB]
 11672	
 11673	Great events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the
 11674	Bastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was
 11675	stormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed. On the night of August 4, the
 11676	feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
 11677	assembly amid great excitement. A few days later came the famous
 11678	Declaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the
 11679	people and the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI
 11680	was forced to accept a new constitution for France vesting the
 11681	legislative power in a popular assembly. Little disorder accompanied
 11682	these startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had
 11683	stripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the
 11684	government of his country on the consent of the governed.
 11685	
 11686	=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political
 11687	revolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American
 11688	Revolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,
 11689	reported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table
 11690	of General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at
 11691	conferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage
 11692	learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the
 11693	leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,
 11694	who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,
 11695	carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding
 11696	system of popular government.
 11697	
 11698	On the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by
 11699	French conservatives as playing with fire. "When we think of the false
 11700	ideas of government and philanthropy," wrote one of Lafayette's aides,
 11701	"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so
 11702	much enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation
 11703	powerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of
 11704	it--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for
 11705	themselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes
 11706	had stayed at home in attendance on the court."
 11707	
 11708	=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the
 11709	ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every
 11710	step in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause
 11711	in the United States. "Liberty will have another feather in her cap,"
 11712	exultantly wrote a Boston editor. "In no part of the globe," soberly
 11713	wrote John Marshall, "was this revolution hailed with more joy than in
 11714	America.... But one sentiment existed." The main key to the Bastille,
 11715	sent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as "a token of the
 11716	victory gained by liberty." Thomas Paine saw in the great event "the
 11717	first ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe."
 11718	Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France
 11719	as another vindication of American ideals.
 11720	
 11721	=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being
 11722	exchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many
 11723	noblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into
 11724	Germany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of
 11725	government. Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother
 11726	monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,
 11727	and he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by
 11728	attempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken
 11729	back to Paris in disgrace.
 11730	
 11731	A new phase of the revolution now opened. The working people, excluded
 11732	from all share in the government by the first French constitution,
 11733	became restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,
 11734	a great open field, they signed a petition calling for another
 11735	constitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they
 11736	refused and were fired upon by the national guard. This "massacre," as
 11737	it was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as
 11738	"Jacobins," then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in
 11739	which it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of
 11740	the popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was
 11741	immediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,
 11742	Louis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,
 11743	was added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which
 11744	radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers
 11745	counter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the
 11746	monarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their
 11747	rule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.
 11748	Terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,
 11749	and in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now
 11750	seemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into
 11751	anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.
 11752	
 11753	=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke
 11754	led the fight against the new French principles which he feared might
 11755	spread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,
 11756	written in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of
 11757	popular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French
 11758	as monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by
 11759	the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the
 11760	arms of European nations.
 11761	
 11762	=Paine's Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign
 11763	of hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of
 11764	his famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American
 11765	public in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.
 11766	Burke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French
 11767	monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the
 11768	oppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying
 11769	bird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their
 11770	own governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which
 11771	he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted
 11772	that the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic
 11773	societies. Paine answered: "If I ask a man in America if he wants a
 11774	king, he retorts and asks me if I take him for an idiot." To the charge
 11775	that the doctrines of the rights of man were "new fangled," Paine
 11776	replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but
 11777	whether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and
 11778	difficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth
 11779	in due time.
 11780	
 11781	=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course
 11782	of the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,
 11783	exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political
 11784	parties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name
 11785	"Federalists," drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds
 11786	committed during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the
 11787	revolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as "Jacobin"
 11788	everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the
 11789	French Republic. A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailed "the
 11790	atheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the
 11791	French Republicans"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
 11792	Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false
 11793	French propaganda and betraying America. "The editors, patrons, and
 11794	abettors of these vehicles of slander," he exclaimed, "ought to be
 11795	considered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors
 11796	they are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the
 11797	most infamous and detestable."
 11798	
 11799	The Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to
 11800	the Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with
 11801	it. Paine's pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic
 11802	societies, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the
 11803	cities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced
 11804	as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the
 11805	execution of Louis XVI was openly celebrated at a banquet in
 11806	Philadelphia. Harmless titles, such as "Sir," "the Honorable," and "His
 11807	Excellency," were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited
 11808	insisted on adopting the French title, "Citizen," speaking, for example,
 11809	of "Citizen Judge" and "Citizen Toastmaster." Pamphlets in defense of
 11810	the French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the
 11811	propaganda in full swing.
 11812	
 11813	=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or
 11814	rather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America
 11815	without producing any serious results, had it not been for the war
 11816	between England and France, then raging. The English, having command of
 11817	the seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French
 11818	ports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.
 11819	Adding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American
 11820	ships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American
 11821	vessels.
 11822	
 11823	=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic
 11824	turned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over
 11825	as its diplomatic representative "Citizen" Genet, an ardent supporter of
 11826	the new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor
 11827	by the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and
 11828	dined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the
 11829	whole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with
 11830	England. Genet therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base
 11831	of operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;
 11832	and he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France
 11833	under the treaty of 1778.
 11834	
 11835	=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the
 11836	
 11837	rising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm
 11838	course. He received Genet coldly. The demand that the United States aid
 11839	France under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the
 11840	neutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts
 11841	toward either France or England. When Genet continued to hold meetings,
 11842	issue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington
 11843	asked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by
 11844	sending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.
 11845	
 11846	The result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great
 11847	Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they
 11848	had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight
 11849	trade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the
 11850	British to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure
 11851	of American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,
 11852	much to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal
 11853	Federalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with
 11854	England, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his
 11855	influence carried the day.
 11856	
 11857	At this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson
 11858	declared the Jay treaty "an infamous act which is really nothing more
 11859	than an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,
 11860	against the legislature and the people of the United States." Hamilton,
 11861	defending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and
 11862	driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was
 11863	burned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of
 11864	Representatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called
 11865	upon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,
 11866	only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on
 11867	the ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.
 11868	
 11869	=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the
 11870	President in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of
 11871	his second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was
 11872	unconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous
 11873	labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former
 11874	friends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount
 11875	Vernon.
 11876	
 11877	In September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington
 11878	issued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and
 11879	read by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed
 11880	the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He
 11881	warned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the
 11882	spirit of partisanship, saying that in government "of the popular
 11883	character, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be
 11884	encouraged." He likewise cautioned the people against "the insidious
 11885	wiles of foreign influence," saying: "Europe has a set of primary
 11886	interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she
 11887	must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are
 11888	essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be
 11889	unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary
 11890	vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions
 11891	of her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so
 11892	peculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of
 11893	permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking
 11894	care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a
 11895	respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary
 11896	alliances for extraordinary emergencies."
 11897	
 11898	=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of
 11899	Washington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of
 11900	France and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the
 11901	monarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name
 11902	"Republican"; the term "Democrat," then applied only to obscure and
 11903	despised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected
 11904	Jefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the
 11905	Federalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they
 11906	came within four votes of electing him.
 11907	
 11908	The successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion
 11909	for conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious
 11910	man. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of
 11911	his books he had declared himself in favor of "government by an
 11912	aristocracy of talents and wealth"--an offense which the Republicans
 11913	never forgave. While John Marshall found him "a sensible, plain, candid,
 11914	good-tempered man," Jefferson could see in him nothing but a "monocrat"
 11915	and "Anglo-man." Had it not been for the conduct of the French
 11916	government, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine
 11917	popularity during his administration.
 11918	
 11919	=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive
 11920	department established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,
 11921	to stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the
 11922	Jay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations
 11923	solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to
 11924	receive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and
 11925	finally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his
 11926	anxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of
 11927	eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French
 11928	Republic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a
 11929	decent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past
 11930	conduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual
 11931	tribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this
 11932	affair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,
 11933	referring to the Frenchmen who had made the demands as "Mr. X, Mr. Y,
 11934	and Mr. Z."
 11935	
 11936	This insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the
 11937	British, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the
 11938	Republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French
 11939	sympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with
 11940	the Federalists in shouting: "Millions for defense, not a cent for
 11941	tribute!" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was
 11942	once more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head
 11943	of the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went
 11944	on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time
 11945	the Directory had been overthrown. A treaty was readily made with
 11946	Napoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as
 11947	chief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.
 11948	
 11949	=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists
 11950	determined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in
 11951	America and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two
 11952	drastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.
 11953	
 11954	The first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the
 11955	country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as "dangerous" or "had
 11956	reasonable grounds to suspect" of "any treasonable or secret
 11957	machinations against the government."
 11958	
 11959	The second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those
 11960	who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government
 11961	but also every one who wrote, uttered, or published "any false,
 11962	scandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the
 11963	United States or either House of Congress, or the President of the
 11964	United States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring
 11965	them or either of them into contempt or disrepute." This measure was
 11966	hurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear
 11967	provision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging
 11968	the freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the
 11969	consequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,
 11970	exclaiming: "Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different
 11971	thing from violence." John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,
 11972	had he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he
 11973	thought them "useless" and "calculated to create unnecessary discontents
 11974	and jealousies."
 11975	
 11976	The Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish
 11977	and French whose activities against the American government's policy
 11978	respecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,
 11979	on the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican
 11980	newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for
 11981	their caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.
 11982	Bystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though
 11983	ungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before
 11984	Federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the
 11985	prosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The
 11986	Republicans were convinced that their political opponents, having
 11987	saddled upon the country Hamilton's fiscal system and the British
 11988	treaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had
 11989	exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.
 11990	Instead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more
 11991	bitter than ever.
 11992	
 11993	=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take
 11994	advantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring
 11995	the Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.
 11996	His resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,
 11997	signed by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their
 11998	consideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of
 11999	Northern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and
 12000	declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress
 12001	was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of
 12002	grievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a
 12003	doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for
 12004	the future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement
 12005	against the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass
 12006	resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the
 12007	other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the
 12008	rights of the people.
 12009	
 12010	=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the
 12011	election of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their
 12012	efforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the
 12013	odium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for
 12014	approving Hamilton's measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in
 12015	councils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.
 12016	They tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of "Jacobins" and
 12017	"Anarchists"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the
 12018	vote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the
 12019	Republicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured
 12020	eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. "Our beloved
 12021	Adams will now close his bright career," lamented a Federalist
 12022	newspaper. "Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now
 12023	you have cause to triumph!"
 12024	
 12025	[Illustration: _An old cartoon_
 12026	
 12027	A QUARREL BETWEEN A FEDERALIST AND A REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE OF
 12028	REPRESENTATIVES]
 12029	
 12030	Jefferson's election, however, was still uncertain. By a curious
 12031	provision in the Constitution, presidential electors were required to
 12032	vote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,
 12033	the one receiving the highest number of votes to be President and the
 12034	candidate standing next to be Vice President. It so happened that Aaron
 12035	Burr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same
 12036	number of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was
 12037	thrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the
 12038	balance of power. Although it was well known that Burr was not even a
 12039	candidate for President, his friends and many Federalists began
 12040	intriguing for his election to that high office. Had it not been for the
 12041	vigorous action of Hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of
 12042	Jefferson's hands. Not until the thirty-sixth ballot on February 17,
 12043	1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]

 12129	CHAPTER IX
 12130	
 12131	THE JEFFERSONIAN REPUBLICANS IN POWER
 12132	
 12133	
 12134	REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES
 12135	
 12136	=Opposition to Strong Central Government.=--Cherishing especially the
 12137	agricultural interest, as Jefferson said, the Republicans were in the
 12138	beginning provincial in their concern and outlook. Their attachment to
 12139	America was, certainly, as strong as that of Hamilton; but they regarded
 12140	the state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of
 12141	power and affection. Indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been
 12142	among the opponents of the Constitution in the days of its adoption.
 12143	Jefferson had entertained doubts about it and Monroe, destined to be the
 12144	fifth President, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. The
 12145	former went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted
 12146	the state above the nation in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798,
 12147	declaring the Constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent
 12148	to interpret and nullify federal law. This was provincialism with a
 12149	vengeance. "It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited
 12150	constitutions," wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy
 12151	of the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that
 12152	reflected the provincial and agricultural interest.
 12153	
 12154	=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its
 12155	early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it
 12156	professed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give
 12157	weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of
 12158	monarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson's
 12159	inauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at
 12160	Washington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this
 12161	procedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of
 12162	reading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted
 12163	in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that
 12164	was continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the
 12165	example set by the first chief magistrate.
 12166	
 12167	=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great
 12168	national debt as the source of a dangerous "money power," giving
 12169	strength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off
 12170	as rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked
 12171	upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they
 12172	reduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,
 12173	particularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense
 12174	satisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost
 12175	of the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds
 12176	of men from the army and abolishing many offices.
 12177	
 12178	They had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to
 12179	enforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of
 12180	speech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of
 12181	the Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon
 12182	offenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase
 12183	by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the
 12184	Federalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had
 12185	regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the
 12186	last hours of Adams' administration as an attempt to intrench
 12187	Federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national
 12188	government. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new
 12189	judgeships, thus depriving the "midnight appointees" of their posts.
 12190	They had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources
 12191	of great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to
 12192	the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed
 12193	according to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they
 12194	occurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be
 12195	said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party
 12196	workers.
 12197	
 12198	The Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of
 12199	restricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national
 12200	government. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,
 12201	prepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. "If there be
 12202	any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican
 12203	form," wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, "let them stand
 12204	undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may
 12205	be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it." After reciting the
 12206	fortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the
 12207	future of America so full of promise, Jefferson concluded: "A wise and
 12208	frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,
 12209	shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of
 12210	industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the
 12211	bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is
 12212	necessary to close the circle of our felicities."
 12213	
 12214	In all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few
 12215	short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of
 12216	the country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the
 12217	Constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;
 12218	to wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reestablish the hated
 12219	United States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their
 12220	Federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and
 12221	provincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and
 12222	to behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions
 12223	of states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the
 12224	Supreme Court of the United States.
 12225	
 12226	
 12227	THE REPUBLICANS AND THE GREAT WEST
 12228	
 12229	=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which
 12230	drove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase
 12231	of the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than
 12232	of their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his
 12233	cherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to
 12234	the original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest
 12235	territory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,
 12236	and a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the
 12237	north bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,
 12238	where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had
 12239	pushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were
 12240	still wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions
 12241	were vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost
 12242	unexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory
 12243	enough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century
 12244	to come.
 12245	
 12246	=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,
 12247	then the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters
 12248	of the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of
 12249	New York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and
 12250	to Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of
 12251	government, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national
 12252	economy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,
 12253	they comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers
 12254	at Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to
 12255	one that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.
 12256	
 12257	On the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,
 12258	unlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the
 12259	wilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld
 12260	the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river
 12261	they floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for
 12262	the ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the
 12263	mountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,
 12264	were almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,
 12265	and coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. A free
 12266	outlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of
 12267	the Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of
 12268	that metropolis.
 12269	
 12270	=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep
 12271	solicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the
 12272	Seven Years' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New
 12273	Orleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the
 12274	Mississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor
 12275	the navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,
 12276	Washington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from
 12277	Spain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied
 12278	the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay
 12279	their fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of
 12280	events altered the whole situation.
 12281	
 12282	=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from
 12283	Spain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to
 12284	American produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,
 12285	was confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to
 12286	France by a secret treaty signed in 1800. "The scalers of the Alps and
 12287	conquerors of Venice" now looked across the sea for new scenes of
 12288	adventure. The West was ablaze with excitement. A call for war ran
 12289	through the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing
 12290	of the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon
 12291	Jefferson.
 12292	
 12293	=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn
 12294	enemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never
 12295	winced. "The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,"
 12296	he wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, "works sorely on
 12297	the United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of
 12298	the United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....
 12299	There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our
 12300	natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce
 12301	of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,
 12302	placing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.
 12303	Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific
 12304	dispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our
 12305	facilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....
 12306	The day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence
 12307	which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals
 12308	the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive
 12309	possession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the
 12310	British fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or
 12311	desire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us
 12312	as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its
 12313	necessary effect."
 12314	
 12315	=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing
 12316	only the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James
 12317	Monroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.
 12318	Before Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already
 12319	convinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might
 12320	be wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially
 12321	as the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more
 12322	raging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no
 12323	thought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when
 12324	Napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business
 12325	altogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to
 12326	accept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay
 12327	$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due
 12328	French citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain
 12329	protested, Napoleon's brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the
 12330	deed was done.
 12331	
 12332	=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this
 12333	extraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled
 12334	with astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.
 12335	He had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,
 12336	and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was
 12337	puzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line
 12338	authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an
 12339	amendment declaring "Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the
 12340	United States." He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big
 12341	national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more
 12342	bonds himself.
 12343	
 12344	In the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw
 12345	from the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the
 12346	Senate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original
 12347	idea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely
 12348	concluded: "If our friends shall think differently, I shall certainly
 12349	acquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our
 12350	country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill
 12351	effects." Thus the stanch advocate of "strict interpretation" cut loose
 12352	from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution
 12353	to "the good sense" of his countrymen.
 12354	
 12355	=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the
 12356	West, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as
 12357	unconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton's masterly defense of the
 12358	bank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if "the
 12359	howling wilderness" ever should be settled, it would turn against the
 12360	East, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.
 12361	Still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the
 12362	dominance of a "hotch potch of wild men from the Far West." Federalists,
 12363	who thought "the broad back of America" could readily bear Hamilton's
 12364	consolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than
 12365	one-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson's party with a high
 12366	hand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,
 12367	ratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down
 12368	from the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and
 12369	Stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,
 12370	Marquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.
 12371	
 12372	[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1805]
 12373	
 12374	By a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more
 12375	than doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is
 12376	safe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,
 12377	Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large
 12378	portions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and
 12379	Wyoming. The farm lands that the friends of "a little America" on the
 12380	seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,
 12381	fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five
 12382	hundred times the price paid to Napoleon.
 12383	
 12384	=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely
 12385	began to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new
 12386	country by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,
 12387	discover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the
 12388	Missouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of
 12389	this mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the
 12390	autumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of
 12391	Lewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the
 12392	forward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western
 12393	empire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored
 12394	the sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish
 12395	territories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the
 12396	work of diplomats.
 12397	
 12398	
 12399	THE REPUBLICAN WAR FOR COMMERCIAL INDEPENDENCE
 12400	
 12401	=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana
 12402	to the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a
 12403	short lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that
 12404	had plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and
 12405	Adams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. The
 12406	party whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for
 12407	defending his treaty, jeered Washington's proclamation of neutrality,
 12408	and spoken bitterly of "timid traders," could no longer take refuge in
 12409	criticism. It had to act.
 12410	
 12411	Its troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined
 12412	effort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of
 12413	Europe blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon
 12414	retaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the
 12415	British Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose
 12416	vessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had
 12417	no navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a
 12418	still more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified
 12419	its blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not
 12420	carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on
 12421	condition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and
 12422	paying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and
 12423	he denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then
 12424	closed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of
 12425	December, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with
 12426	the British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French
 12427	authorities.
 12428	
 12429	=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire
 12430	need of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American
 12431	ships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on
 12432	board. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for
 12433	trivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the
 12434	American marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen
 12435	were English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language
 12436	was no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both
 12437	countries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.
 12438	Moreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--"Once an Englishman,
 12439	always an Englishman"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in
 12440	favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he
 12441	would give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and
 12442	often enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in
 12443	their own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when
 12444	executed with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it
 12445	meant that American ships were forced to "come to," and compelled to
 12446	rest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried
 12447	into records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints
 12448	could not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only
 12449	saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.
 12450	
 12451	Had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and
 12452	knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment
 12453	might not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made
 12454	in sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,
 12455	firing on one another and chasing one another in American waters within
 12456	the three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate
 12457	_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King
 12458	George's navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three
 12459	men and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry
 12460	could hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,
 12461	it was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because
 12462	so few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in
 12463	American waters.
 12464	
 12465	=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part
 12466	of European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their
 12467	enterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the
 12468	Atlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American
 12469	merchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French
 12470	marine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with
 12471	the sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The
 12472	American shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in
 12473	1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was
 12474	the enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American
 12475	ships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French
 12476	privateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,
 12477	ranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they
 12478	failed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of
 12479	capture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.
 12480	American sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the
 12481	Orders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to
 12482	French vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan
 12483	Decree.
 12484	
 12485	=Jefferson's Policy.=--The President's dilemma was distressing. Both the
 12486	belligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.
 12487	War on both of them was out of the question. War on France was
 12488	impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which
 12489	could be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been
 12490	shattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great
 12491	Britain, a power which Jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was
 12492	possible but not inviting. Jefferson shrank from it. A man of peace, he
 12493	disliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at
 12494	the death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the
 12495	eight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after
 12496	measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,
 12497	Commodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon
 12498	American commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate
 12499	earnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect
 12500	American rights.
 12501	
 12502	=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and
 12503	Jefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to
 12504	certain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club
 12505	over the British government's head. This law, failing in its purpose,
 12506	Jefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo
 12507	Act forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.
 12508	France and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their
 12509	supplies.
 12510	
 12511	The result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to
 12512	give up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge
 12513	profits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained
 12514	by law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West
 12515	found their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon
 12516	curtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national
 12517	significance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and
 12518	sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods
 12519	doubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law
 12520	smuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.
 12521	
 12522	Jefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only
 12523	alternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without
 12524	offering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan
 12525	that brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on
 12526	all sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson's administration,
 12527	repealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act
 12528	forbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other
 12529	countries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on
 12530	American shipping.
 12531	
 12532	=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by
 12533	endless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage
 12534	criticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to "stay by the
 12535	ship" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for
 12536	life might result from repeated reelection. In following Washington's
 12537	course and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his
 12538	successors, making the "third term doctrine" a part of American
 12539	unwritten law.
 12540	
 12541	His intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens
 12542	of his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a
 12543	leader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and
 12544	council chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,
 12545	sensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough
 12546	and tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and
 12547	distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.
 12548	He had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton's measures.
 12549	Later he attached himself to Jefferson's fortunes and served for eight
 12550	years as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of
 12551	the Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now
 12552	as President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments
 12553	in all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and
 12554	following in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the
 12555	foreign problem by negotiation.
 12556	
 12557	=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up
 12558	his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.
 12559	In the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near
 12560	the harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American
 12561	citizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an
 12562	American warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into
 12563	the _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.
 12564	The British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded
 12565	together the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave
 12566	signs of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm
 12567	along the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,
 12568	Tecumseh's men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry
 12569	Harrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it
 12570	seemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,
 12571	the Red Men would soon be subdued.
 12572	
 12573	=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were
 12574	flying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the
 12575	uncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,
 12576	dubbed "Young Republicans," under the leadership of two members destined
 12577	to be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and
 12578	John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The former contended, in a flair of
 12579	folly, that "the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place
 12580	Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet." The latter with a light heart
 12581	spoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks' campaign. "It must not be
 12582	inferred," says Channing, "that in advocating conquest, the Westerners
 12583	were actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they
 12584	
 12585	thought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The
 12586	savages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at
 12587	Quebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida
 12588	and they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern
 12589	opposition to this acquisition of slave territory." While Clay and
 12590	Calhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what
 12591	Napoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers
 12592	still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war
 12593	for independence and that the embers of the old hatred for George III,
 12594	still on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.
 12595	
 12596	=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British
 12597	ministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in
 12598	adhering to the policy of "watchful waiting." One of them, a high Tory,
 12599	believed that all Americans were alike "except that a few are less
 12600	knaves than others" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the
 12601	recall of this minister the British government selected another no less
 12602	high and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became
 12603	thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the
 12604	pressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing
 12605	on June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In
 12606	proclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which
 12607	justified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the
 12608	Indians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined
 12609	American trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by
 12610	stopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American
 12611	sailors and driven them into the British navy.
 12612	
 12613	=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without
 12614	bringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General
 12615	Hull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada
 12616	were offset by Perry's victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow
 12617	administered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of
 12618	Plattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for
 12619	the humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.
 12620	The stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the
 12621	_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a
 12622	hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the
 12623	iron blockade finally established by the British government when it came
 12624	to appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of
 12625	the sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and
 12626	the reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great
 12627	Britain.
 12628	
 12629	All this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a
 12630	government less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It
 12631	had neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies
 12632	required by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that
 12633	favored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and
 12634	financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,
 12635	was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even
 12636	after Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring
 12637	of 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict
 12638	temporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties
 12639	and free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with
 12640	the United States, especially as that could be done without conceding
 12641	anything or surrendering any claims.
 12642	
 12643	=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that
 12644	offered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual
 12645	diplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss
 12646	terms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on
 12647	Christmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson's victory at New Orleans.
 12648	When the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that
 12649	it said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction
 12650	of American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of
 12651	Indians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people "passed
 12652	from gloom to glory" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were
 12653	rung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing
 12654	toast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could
 12655	continue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,
 12656	Great Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and
 12657	confiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible
 12658	sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with
 12659	the sails of merchantmen.
 12660	
 12661	
 12662	THE REPUBLICANS NATIONALIZED
 12663	
 12664	=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune's wheel,
 12665	the party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,
 12666	became the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,
 12667	finding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and
 12668	then penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great
 12669	Britain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the
 12670	course of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to
 12671	treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;
 12672	and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of
 12673	nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.
 12674	The Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved
 12675	that it was waged "without justifiable cause," and refused to approve
 12676	military and naval projects not connected with "the defense of our
 12677	seacoast and soil." A Boston newspaper declared that the union was
 12678	nothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide
 12679	for themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed
 12680	resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or
 12681	treason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration
 12682	at Washington that "the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and
 12683	independent state." Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which
 12684	had drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another
 12685	conference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the
 12686	union.
 12687	
 12688	[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_
 12689	
 12690	NEW ENGLAND JUMPING INTO THE HANDS OF GEORGE III]
 12691	
 12692	In October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,
 12693	Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and
 12694	Vermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels
 12695	of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on
 12696	record to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the
 12697	Constitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and
 12698	palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority
 12699	for the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the
 12700	states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus
 12701	New England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its
 12702	actions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely
 12703	proposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the
 12704	close of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who
 12705	made them were hopelessly discredited.
 12706	
 12707	=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards
 12708	nullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost
 12709	all their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures
 12710	of reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national
 12711	devices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of
 12712	twenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which
 12713	Jefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and
 12714	unconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and
 12715	circumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of
 12716	constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while
 12717	Madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.
 12718	
 12719	=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank
 12720	by another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it
 12721	as the beginning of his "American system" of protection. Calhoun
 12722	defended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy
 12723	the young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party
 12724	colleagues with betraying the "agricultural interest" that Jefferson had
 12725	fostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. "When the
 12726	seas are open," he said, "the produce of the South may pour anywhere
 12727	into the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with
 12728	a maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our
 12729	agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the
 12730	farmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar
 12731	pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great
 12732	staples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the
 12733	event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....
 12734	When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon
 12735	will be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer
 12736	experience these evils." With the Republicans nationalized, the
 12737	Federalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing
 12738	defeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.
 12739	
 12740	=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political
 12741	contest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national
 12742	importance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening
 12743	the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to
 12744	states. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The
 12745	acquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow "unvexed to the sea";
 12746	but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,
 12747	affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the
 12748	pioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as
 12749	to the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West
 12750	Florida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps
 12751	were a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the
 12752	frontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the
 12753	sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into
 12754	alien territory.
 12755	
 12756	The pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President
 12757	Monroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson
 12758	to seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited
 12759	warrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,
 12760	replied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could
 12761	occupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to
 12762	this letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was
 12763	master of the Spanish king's domain to the south.
 12764	
 12765	There was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the
 12766	inevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for
 12767	five million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims
 12768	against Spain. On Washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It
 12769	ceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between
 12770	Mexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the
 12771	Sabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this
 12772	occasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to
 12773	inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and
 12774	incorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away
 12775	from the days of "strict construction." And Jefferson still lived!
 12776	
 12777	=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national
 12778	idea was Monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his
 12779	name. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic
 12780	upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies
 12781	in America, following the example set by their English neighbors in
 12782	1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the
 12783	king of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that
 12784	looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.
 12785	
 12786	_The Holy Alliance._--He found them prepared to view his case with
 12787	sympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the
 12788	leadership of the Czar, Alexander I, in the autumn of 1815, had entered
 12789	into a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic
 12790	principle in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language
 12791	of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was
 12792	later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and
 12793	growth of popular government.
 12794	
 12795	The American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a
 12796	conference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at
 12797	Verona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken
 12798	out in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the
 12799	first article of the agreement reached by the delegates: "The high
 12800	contracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative
 12801	government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and
 12802	the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,
 12803	mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to
 12804	put an end to the system of representative government in whatever
 12805	country it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in
 12806	those countries where it is not yet known." The Czar, who incidentally
 12807	coveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid
 12808	the king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for
 12809	intervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of
 12810	spirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war
 12811	on popular government.
 12812	
 12813	_The Position of England._--Unfortunately, too, for the Holy Alliance,
 12814	England refused to cooperate. English merchants had built up a large
 12815	trade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested
 12816	against the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of
 12817	Spain's former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been
 12818	laid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly
 12819	established. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood
 12820	which was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the
 12821	suffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,
 12822	therefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of
 12823	cooperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they
 12824	turned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime
 12825	minister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring
 12826	their unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other
 12827	power.
 12828	
 12829	_Jefferson's Advice._--The proposal was rejected; but President Monroe
 12830	took up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his
 12831	Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson
 12832	said: "One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of
 12833	freedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By
 12834	acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her
 12835	mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a
 12836	continent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the
 12837	whole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial
 12838	friendship."
 12839	
 12840	_Monroe's Statement of the Doctrine._--Acting on the advice of trusted
 12841	friends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on
 12842	December 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the
 12843	world as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced
 12844	that he would regard "any attempt on their part to extend their system
 12845	to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."
 12846	While he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent
 12847	on European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that
 12848	had declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to
 12849	oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as
 12850	"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States."
 12851	Referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the
 12852	Czar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old
 12853	World that "the American continents, by the free and independent
 12854	condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to
 12855	be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European
 12856	powers." The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men
 12857	whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were
 12858	led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of
 12859	the earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.
 12860	
 12861	=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of
 12862	this period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations
 12863	under the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,
 12864	they insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced
 12865	against the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to
 12866	the prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line
 12867	36 o 30'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been
 12868	presented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for
 12869	abolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest
 12870	Ordinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from
 12871	practice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his
 12872	cabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,
 12873	and Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian
 12874	principle of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous
 12875	verdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit
 12876	slavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he
 12877	approved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the
 12878	compromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress
 12879	stood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in
 12880	the Dred Scott case.
 12881	
 12882	
 12883	THE NATIONAL DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL
 12884	
 12885	=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges
 12886	of state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their
 12887	leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were
 12888	assisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John
 12889	Marshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
 12890	States from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution
 12891	above the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his
 12892	political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his
 12893	superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will
 12894	likewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament
 12895	to the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was
 12896	American. Born on the frontier of Virginia, reared in a log cabin,
 12897	granted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and
 12898	rough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor
 12899	America can bestow.
 12900	
 12901	On him the bitter experience of the Revolution and of later days made a
 12902	lasting impression. He was no "summer patriot." He had been a soldier in
 12903	the Revolutionary army. He had suffered with Washington at Valley Forge.
 12904	He had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the
 12905	Continental Congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force
 12906	the states to do their full duty. To him the Articles of Confederation
 12907	were the symbol of futility. Into the struggle for the formation of the
 12908	Constitution and its ratification in Virginia he had thrown himself with
 12909	the ardor of a soldier. Later, as a member of Congress, a representative
 12910	to France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in
 12911	establishing the new government. When at length they were driven from
 12912	power in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he
 12913	was chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic
 12914	irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas
 12915	Jefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence
 12916	had retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to
 12917	announce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.
 12918	
 12919	[Illustration: JOHN MARSHALL]
 12920	
 12921	=Marbury _vs._ Madison--An Act of Congress Annulled.=--He had been in
 12922	his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in
 12923	the name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power
 12924	to declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it
 12925	violates the Constitution. This power was not expressly conferred on the
 12926	Court. Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the
 12927	government enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established
 12928	until 1803 when the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison was decided. In
 12929	rendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He
 12930	sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it
 12931	on the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his
 12932	reasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who
 12933	act in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress
 12934	and defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its
 12935	limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,
 12936	then the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,
 12937	however, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the
 12938	duty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against
 12939	measures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American
 12940	constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts
 12941	which are not authorized. "A law repugnant to the Constitution," he
 12942	closed, "is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound
 12943	by that instrument." From that day to this the practice of federal and
 12944	state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained
 12945	unshaken.
 12946	
 12947	This doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with
 12948	consternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, "then indeed is our
 12949	Constitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,
 12950	intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent
 12951	that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according
 12952	to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for
 12953	the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected
 12954	by and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this
 12955	hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which
 12956	they may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be
 12957	remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever
 12958	power in any government is independent, is absolute also.... A judiciary
 12959	independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but
 12960	independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a
 12961	republican government." But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,
 12962	though from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson's opinion,
 12963	likewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing
 12964	upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.
 12965	
 12966	=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall
 12967	stopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less
 12968	criticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set
 12969	aside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they
 12970	violated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher
 12971	_vs._ Peck, he annulled an act of the Georgia legislature, informing the
 12972	state that it was not sovereign, but "a part of a large empire, ... a
 12973	member of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...
 12974	which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states." In the
 12975	case of McCulloch _vs._ Maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an
 12976	act of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the
 12977	United States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the
 12978	still more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the
 12979	New Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by
 12980	the college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was
 12981	a contract between the state and the college, which the legislature
 12982	under the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he
 12983	stirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme
 12984	Court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was
 12985	involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in
 12986	the case of Cohens _vs._ Virginia.
 12987	
 12988	All these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed
 12989	sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never
 12990	turned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he
 12991	fairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme
 12992	Court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the
 12993	laws of the states; and "those sovereignties," far from possessing the
 12994	right of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the
 12995	decisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the
 12996	Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford
 12997	convention; but they had to take it.
 12998	
 12999	=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the
 13000	Marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall
 13001	also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the
 13002	Constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch
 13003	_vs._ Maryland, he construed generously the words "necessary and proper"
 13004	in such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of "implied
 13005	powers" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among
 13006	other things, the question whether the act establishing the second
 13007	United States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered
 13008	in the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over
 13009	taxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise
 13010	of these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely
 13011	necessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. "With respect
 13012	to the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be
 13013	carried into execution," he said, Congress must be allowed the
 13014	discretion which "will enable that body to perform the high duties
 13015	assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people." In short,
 13016	the Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a
 13017	flexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet
 13018	national problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall
 13019	used language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,
 13020	standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he
 13021	said that "a government of the people, by the people, for the people
 13022	shall not perish from the earth."
 13023	
 13024	
 13025	SUMMARY OF THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS
 13026	
 13027	During the strenuous period between the establishment of American
 13028	independence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American
 13029	experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All
 13030	the Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part
 13031	in the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,
 13032	lived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the "age of the fathers." It
 13033	saw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of
 13034	Confederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political
 13035	parties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the
 13036	apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.
 13037	
 13038	The new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles
 13039	began. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running
 13040	expenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures
 13041	against European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of
 13042	paper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic
 13043	uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.
 13044	Without money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under
 13045	the Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,
 13046	who had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy
 13047	again. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new
 13048	constitution alone could save America from disaster.
 13049	
 13050	By dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced
 13051	the Congress to call a national convention to take into account the
 13052	state of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for
 13053	months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small
 13054	states clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed
 13055	that they would never grant it. A spirit of conciliation, fair play, and
 13056	compromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there
 13057	were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.
 13058	Here, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates
 13059	feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions
 13060	also had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the
 13061	Constitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for
 13062	approval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states
 13063	ratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George
 13064	Washington was inaugurated first President.
 13065	
 13066	The new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume
 13067	the debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay
 13068	the bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.
 13069	Hamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered
 13070	opposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two
 13071	political parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists
 13072	and the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with
 13073	political debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the
 13074	Republicans with Jefferson in the lead.
 13075	
 13076	By their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states
 13077	rather than the new national government, but in practice they added
 13078	immensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased
 13079	Louisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence
 13080	against England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted
 13081	the protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to
 13082	abolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread
 13083	the shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and
 13084	Europe.
 13085	
 13086	Still America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion
 13087	flowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in
 13088	Europe looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events
 13089	in Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French
 13090	Revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political
 13091	debate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored
 13092	it. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American
 13093	opinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of
 13094	Napoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready
 13095	for war.
 13096	
 13097	The conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war
 13098	broke out between England and France and raged with only a slight
 13099	intermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American
 13100	commerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had
 13101	command of the seas. Though Jefferson and Madison strove for peace, the
 13102	country was swept into war by the vehemence of the "Young Republicans,"
 13103	headed by Clay and Calhoun.
 13104	
 13105	When the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. The
 13106	autocratic powers of Europe threatened to intervene on behalf of Spain
 13107	in her attempt to recover possession of her Latin-American colonies.
 13108	Their challenge to America brought forth the Monroe Doctrine. The powers
 13109	of Europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the
 13110	republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new
 13111	colonization in it. It seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful
 13112	triumph over sectionalism.

 13205	
 13206	CHAPTER X
 13207	
 13208	THE FARMERS BEYOND THE APPALACHIANS
 13209	
 13210	
 13211	The nationalism of Hamilton was undemocratic. The democracy of Jefferson
 13212	was, in the beginning, provincial. The historic mission of uniting
 13213	nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders
 13214	from a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all
 13215	sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the
 13216	early days of colonization. The voice of the democratic nationalism
 13217	nourished in the West was heard when Clay of Kentucky advocated his
 13218	American system of protection for industries; when Jackson of Tennessee
 13219	condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its
 13220	place among the great American state papers; and when Lincoln of
 13221	Illinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the
 13222	supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.
 13223	And it will be remembered that Lincoln's party chose for its banner that
 13224	earlier device--Republican--which Jefferson had made a sign of power.
 13225	The "rail splitter" from Illinois united the nationalism of Hamilton
 13226	with the democracy of Jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the
 13227	simple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which
 13228	Webster learned in the schools.
 13229	
 13230	
 13231	PREPARATION FOR WESTERN SETTLEMENT
 13232	
 13233	=The West and the American Revolution.=--The excessive attention devoted
 13234	by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured
 13235	the role played by the frontier in the American Revolution. The action
 13236	of Great Britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was
 13237	more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.
 13238	Americans on the frontier did not forget it; when Indians were employed
 13239	by England to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the
 13240	interior aflame. It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel
 13241	Boone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the
 13242	value of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where
 13243	the Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was
 13244	they who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the
 13245	leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. It
 13246	was one of their number, a seasoned Indian fighter, George Rogers Clark,
 13247	who with aid from Virginia seized Kaskaskia and Vincennes and secured
 13248	the whole Northwest to the union while the fate of Washington's army was
 13249	still hanging in the balance.
 13250	
 13251	=Western Problems at the End of the Revolution.=--The treaty of peace,
 13252	signed with Great Britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the
 13253	coveted territory west to the Mississippi River, but it left unsolved
 13254	many problems. In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the
 13255	Ohio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to
 13256	be reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the
 13257	federal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to
 13258	guarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons
 13259	still occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of
 13260	the treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the
 13261	ratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,
 13262	Virginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the
 13263	land in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.
 13264	It was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement
 13265	to transfer their rights to the government of the United States,
 13266	Virginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth
 13267	place, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the
 13268	absence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,
 13269	Congress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it
 13270	out into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In
 13271	every township one section of land was set aside for the support of
 13272	public schools.
 13273	
 13274	=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved
 13275	before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing
 13276	the territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile
 13277	valley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of
 13278	the Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants
 13279	entitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.
 13280	
 13281	Congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance
 13282	providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the
 13283	creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free
 13284	males in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal
 13285	footing with the original states was promised to the new territories.
 13286	Religious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,
 13287	regular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order
 13288	that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the
 13289	rough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on
 13290	the Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and
 13291	involuntary servitude.
 13292	
 13293	This Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the
 13294	Articles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress
 13295	under the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential
 13296	provisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory
 13297	south of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,
 13298	and in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it
 13299	was settled for all time that "the new colonies were not to be exploited
 13300	for the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of
 13301	England) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths." This
 13302	outcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph
 13303	of Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary
 13304	by way of preparation for the flood of settlers.
 13305	
 13306	=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the
 13307	original settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great
 13308	companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787
 13309	the Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a
 13310	half acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of
 13311	Marietta. A professional land speculator, J.C. Symmes, secured a million
 13312	acres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other
 13313	individuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings
 13314	for speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes
 13315	quickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry
 13316	out against the "rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the
 13317	North West of the Ohio," protesting that "scarce a valuable spot within
 13318	any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant." He therefore
 13319	urged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not "too
 13320	exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to
 13321	discourage monopolizers."
 13322	
 13323	Congress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the
 13324	sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It
 13325	still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of
 13326	revenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought
 13327	more of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on
 13328	the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre
 13329	in 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the
 13330	first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small
 13331	registration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few
 13332	thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he
 13333	was fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which
 13334	were spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for
 13335	himself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in
 13336	1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,
 13337	the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract
 13338	capital to land ventures.
 13339	
 13340	=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the
 13341	scarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge
 13342	estate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a
 13343	farm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was
 13344	due in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of
 13345	the balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a
 13346	family could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could
 13347	meet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many
 13348	a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;
 13349	yet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a
 13350	few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western
 13351	agriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands
 13352	of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.
 13353	
 13354	The tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,
 13355	was also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that
 13356	the land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will
 13357	disposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.
 13358	Hildreth says of this provision: "It established the important
 13359	republican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the
 13360	equal distribution of landed as well as personal property." All these
 13361	forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of
 13362	the nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast
 13363	with the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on
 13364	the law of primogeniture.
 13365	
 13366	
 13367	THE WESTERN MIGRATION AND NEW STATES
 13368	
 13369	=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over
 13370	the Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for
 13371	the immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of
 13372	tilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York
 13373	and Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but
 13374	most of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in
 13375	Pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of
 13376	servitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From
 13377	the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came
 13378	pioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great
 13379	numbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that
 13380	"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a
 13381	continental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement." While native
 13382	Americans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long
 13383	before immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company
 13384	enterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing
 13385	numbers.
 13386	
 13387	The types of people were as various as the nations they represented.
 13388	Timothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,
 13389	found the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.
 13390	Some of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the
 13391	Mississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther
 13392	north, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of
 13393	Mexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and
 13394	trappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with
 13395	their droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish
 13396	farmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,
 13397	like the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed
 13398	the farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared
 13399	every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of
 13400	civilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the
 13401	home makers built for all time.
 13402	
 13403	=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the
 13404	frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during
 13405	the decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time
 13406	record that every road was "crowded" with pioneers and their families,
 13407	their wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of
 13408	the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack
 13409	of the hunter's rifle as he brought down his evening meal. "During the
 13410	latter half of 1787," says Coman, "more than nine hundred boats floated
 13411	down the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and
 13412	twelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty
 13413	wagons." Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing
 13414	years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.
 13415	
 13416	=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the
 13417	Appalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west
 13418	to the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In
 13419	the dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into
 13420	northern Ohio. A second route, through Pittsburgh, was fed by three
 13421	eastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and
 13422	another at Alexandria. A third main route wound through the mountains
 13423	from Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the
 13424	Ohio to St. Louis. A fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through
 13425	the Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley
 13426	and the Kentucky country.
 13427	
 13428	Of these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most
 13429	advantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once
 13430	they were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,
 13431	could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and
 13432	Southwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western
 13433	Tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their
 13434	destination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South
 13435	as well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came
 13436	about that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled
 13437	with those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement
 13438	of the Northwest territory.
 13439	
 13440	=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact
 13441	descriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have
 13442	been preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the
 13443	Old World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their
 13444	way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or
 13445	amuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has
 13446	given us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. "If
 13447	a man ... " he writes, "has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his
 13448	best way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to
 13449	carry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as
 13450	he may come from the Northern or Southern states. A good waggon will
 13451	cost, at Philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they
 13452	would cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon
 13453	may be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they
 13454	may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike
 13455	that, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the
 13456	different roads.... The provisions I would purchase in the same manner
 13457	[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three
 13458	camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon
 13459	the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress
 13460	their own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being
 13461	disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant." The
 13462	immigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a
 13463	size required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his
 13464	journey's end.
 13465	
 13466	[Illustration: ROADS AND TRAILS INTO THE WESTERN TERRITORY]
 13467	
 13468	=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century
 13469	drew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode
 13470	Island, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792
 13471	Kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,
 13472	Virginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took
 13473	some consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of
 13474	Eastern power was still retained.
 13475	
 13476	As if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas
 13477	the makers of Kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed
 13478	qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.
 13479	Four years later, Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed
 13480	this step toward a wider democracy. After encountering fierce opposition
 13481	from the Federalists, Tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.
 13482	
 13483	=Ohio.=--The door of the union had hardly opened for Tennessee when
 13484	another appeal was made to Congress, this time from the pioneers in
 13485	Ohio. The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into
 13486	flourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the
 13487	river, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all
 13488	around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for "store
 13489	goods." After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British
 13490	soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of
 13491	1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the "Western
 13492	Reserve," a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she
 13493	surrendered her other rights in the Northwest.
 13494	
 13495	At the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than
 13496	50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years
 13497	before the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that
 13498	region had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after
 13499	the fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old
 13500	Connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true
 13501	son of New England declared that men "have an undoubted right to pass
 13502	into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that
 13503	from the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not
 13504	empowered to forbid them." This grand convention was never held because
 13505	the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit
 13506	of John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen
 13507	by voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,
 13508	drew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.
 13509	The roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,
 13510	Huntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which
 13511	they came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and
 13512	Washington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led
 13513	by the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.
 13514	
 13515	=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in
 13516	Indiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,
 13517	however, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for
 13518	better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of
 13519	Virginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging
 13520	upward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the
 13521	Wabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for
 13522	statehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the
 13523	Indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at
 13524	Corydon. "The majority of the members of the convention," we are told by
 13525	a local historian, "were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what
 13526	they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues
 13527	put it into shape."
 13528	
 13529	Two years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the
 13530	Ohio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.
 13531	Leadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in
 13532	New York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally
 13533	drafted "was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing
 13534	constitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles
 13535	are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and
 13536	numbered."
 13537	
 13538	=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the
 13539	far south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and
 13540	enterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French
 13541	and Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with
 13542	their armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market
 13543	and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In
 13544	1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had
 13545	come, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to
 13546	France in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of
 13547	the territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists
 13548	from New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,
 13549	still protested in tones of horror. "I am compelled to declare it as my
 13550	deliberate opinion," pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of
 13551	Representatives, "that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the
 13552	bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the
 13553	right of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare
 13554	definitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they
 13555	must.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards
 13556	linger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be
 13557	consummated." Federalists from New York like those from New England had
 13558	their doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party
 13559	of Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the
 13560	coveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.
 13561	
 13562	When, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of
 13563	the union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their
 13564	conduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the
 13565	Southwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,
 13566	and Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of
 13567	America. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their
 13568	constitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed
 13569	qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.
 13570	
 13571	=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new
 13572	commonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came
 13573	down the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from
 13574	Kentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers
 13575	from Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking
 13576	freemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out
 13577	fields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the
 13578	Missouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,
 13579	small farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their
 13580	numbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest
 13581	over their admission to the union, "ringing an alarm bell in the night,"
 13582	as Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with
 13583	slavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was
 13584	brought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the
 13585	same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana
 13586	territory a line separating servitude from slavery.
 13587	
 13588	
 13589	THE SPIRIT OF THE FRONTIER
 13590	
 13591	=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed
 13592	an unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower
 13593	Mississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even
 13594	led in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and
 13595	Kentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the
 13596	Northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense
 13597	dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body
 13598	of people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and
 13599	deriving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands
 13600	on the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all
 13601	the original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of
 13602	agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. "In
 13603	the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition," as
 13604	Webster said on more than one occasion, "lay the true basis, most
 13605	certainly, of popular government." There was the undoubted source of
 13606	Jacksonian democracy.
 13607	
 13608	[Illustration: A LOG CABIN--LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE]
 13609	
 13610	=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the
 13611	Northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed
 13612	that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the
 13613	characteristics common to an independent yeomanry. A close observer thus
 13614	recorded his impressions: "A spirit of adventurous enterprise, a
 13615	willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....
 13616	Independence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of
 13617	these principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that
 13618	have lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the
 13619	deer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans
 13620	all.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of
 13621	manner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people
 13622	who know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but
 13623	where each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all
 13624	that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can
 13625	possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in
 13626	creating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid
 13627	the foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,
 13628	want of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make
 13629	acquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or
 13630	imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West."
 13631	
 13632	This equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by
 13633	the traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the
 13634	character of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,
 13635	eagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the
 13636	hunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,
 13637	farmers of the "middling order," and mechanics from the towns,--English,
 13638	Scotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of
 13639	their own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern
 13640	homes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the
 13641	leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit
 13642	with their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who
 13643	came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and
 13644	schoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that
 13645	savored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter
 13646	Cartwright's _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston's _The Hoosier
 13647	Schoolmaster_.
 13648	
 13649	
 13650	THE WEST AND THE EAST MEET
 13651	
 13652	=The East Alarmed.=--A people so independent as the Westerners and so
 13653	attached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude
 13654	shock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with
 13655	the idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.
 13656	Not without good grounds did Washington fear that "a touch of a feather
 13657	would turn" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the
 13658	Spaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest
 13659	they be "drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners."
 13660	Taking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,
 13661	having disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid
 13662	wild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least
 13663	to build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining
 13664	Louisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of
 13665	the West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed
 13666	equality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the
 13667	West, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage
 13668	to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen
 13669	colonies had been not long before.
 13670	
 13671	=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were
 13672	many Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the
 13673	West, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together
 13674	by common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western
 13675	advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew
 13676	tired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands
 13677	beyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project
 13678	for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was
 13679	active in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He
 13680	advocated strengthening the ties of commerce. "Smooth the roads," he
 13681	said, "and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of
 13682	articles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be
 13683	increased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble
 13684	and expense we may encounter to effect it." Jefferson, too, was
 13685	interested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,
 13686	the exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the
 13687	discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the
 13688	inventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years
 13689	pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a
 13690	canal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,
 13691	and extend the principles of confederate and republican government.
 13692	
 13693	=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication
 13694	played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to
 13695	bring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the
 13696	West--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the
 13697	cost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,
 13698	"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of
 13699	'store clothes' cost as much as a farm." In such circumstances, the
 13700	inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce
 13701	over a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates
 13702	for everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five
 13703	to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down
 13704	the stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going
 13705	vessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the
 13706	Eastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute
 13707	essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were
 13708	carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the

 13711	=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, "the
 13712	father of internal improvements," the solution of this problem was the
 13713	construction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson's administration,
 13714	Congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to
 13715	building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying
 13716	into the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest
 13717	territory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great
 13718	national highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as
 13719	it was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern
 13720	Pennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then
 13721	shot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.
 13722	By 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by
 13723	1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,
 13724	to Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger
 13725	coaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in
 13726	safety at a steady pace.
 13727	
 13728	[Illustration: THE CUMBERLAND ROAD]
 13729	
 13730	=Canals and Steamboats.=--A second epoch in the economic union of the
 13731	East and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,
 13732	offering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and
 13733	the Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages
 13734	conferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and
 13735	portages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in
 13736	1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,
 13737	was busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when
 13738	railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.
 13739	About the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording
 13740	water communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich
 13741	wheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with
 13742	comparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest
 13743	of freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for
 13744	carrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred
 13745	miles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the
 13746	Mississippi Valley.
 13747	
 13748	The diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by
 13749	steamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after
 13750	Fulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to
 13751	sail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to
 13752	twenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a
 13753	day on the new steamer _Grecian_ "against the whole weight of the
 13754	Mississippi current." Three years later the round trip from Louisville
 13755	to New Orleans was cut to eight days. Heavy produce that once had to
 13756	float down to New Orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the East
 13757	by way of the canal systems.
 13758

 13762	
 13763	Thus the far country was brought near. The timid no longer hesitated at
 13764	the thought of the perilous journey. All routes were crowded with
 13765	Western immigrants. The forests fell before the ax like grain before the
 13766	sickle. Clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great
 13767	mosaic of farms stretching from the Southern Appalachians to Lake
 13768	Michigan. The national census of 1830 gave 937,000 inhabitants to Ohio;
 13769	343,000 to Indiana; 157,000 to Illinois; 687,000 to Kentucky; and
 13770	681,000 to Tennessee.

 13773	
 13774	With the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came
 13775	political influence. People who had once petitioned Congress now sent
 13776	their own representatives. Men who had hitherto accepted without
 13777	protests Presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent
 13778	in 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for John Quincy Adams; and
 13779	four years later they sent a son of the soil from Tennessee, Andrew
 13780	Jackson, to take Washington's chair as chief executive of the
 13781	nation--the first of a long line of Presidents from the Mississippi
 13782	basin.

 13859	CHAPTER XI
 13860	
 13861	JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY
 13862	
 13863	
 13864	The New England Federalists, at the Hartford convention, prophesied that
 13865	in time the West would dominate the East. "At the adoption of the
 13866	Constitution," they said, "a certain balance of power among the original
 13867	states was considered to exist, and there was at that time and yet is
 13868	among those parties a strong affinity between their great and general
 13869	interests. By the admission of these [new] states that balance has been
 13870	materially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately
 13871	be destroyed. The Southern states will first avail themselves of their
 13872	new confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,
 13873	multiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the
 13874	interests of the whole." Strangely enough the fulfillment of this
 13875	prophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise
 13876	of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers
 13877	beyond the mountains.
 13878	
 13879	
 13880	THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE EAST
 13881	
 13882	=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary
 13883	fathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they
 13884	often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did
 13885	not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.
 13886	On the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe
 13887	"depositary" of political power. They went back to the colonial
 13888	tradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,
 13889	was not only just but a safeguard against the "excesses of democracy."
 13890	
 13891	In carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or
 13892	property qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these
 13893	limitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),
 13894	New Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who
 13895	paid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,
 13896	Virginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient
 13897	principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral
 13898	rights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,
 13899	accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of
 13900	the requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted
 13901	to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or
 13902	possessed other property worth sixty pounds.
 13903	
 13904	The electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide
 13905	distribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In
 13906	many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because
 13907	heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New
 13908	Hampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in
 13909	land; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,
 13910	five thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North
 13911	Carolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten
 13912	thousand pounds freehold. A state senator in Massachusetts had to be the
 13913	owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property
 13914	worth six hundred pounds; in New Jersey, one thousand pounds' worth of
 13915	property; in North Carolina, three hundred acres of land; in South
 13916	Carolina, two thousand pounds freehold. For members of the lower house
 13917	of the legislature lower qualifications were required.
 13918	
 13919	In most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were
 13920	further restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful
 13921	enough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,
 13922	Catholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.
 13923	North Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a
 13924	Protestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the
 13925	Trinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and
 13926	Maryland limited it to Christians. Virginia and New York, advanced for
 13927	their day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious
 13928	opinion.
 13929	
 13930	=The Defense of the Old Order.=--It must not be supposed that property
 13931	qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of
 13932	little consequence in practice. In the beginning they were viewed as
 13933	fundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens
 13934	increased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In
 13935	Massachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in
 13936	government, saying: "It is entirely just that property should have its
 13937	due weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The
 13938	disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political
 13939	thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society
 13940	to their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property."
 13941	In Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to
 13942	remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: "What does the delegate
 13943	propose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar
 13944	hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?"
 13945	In Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property
 13946	qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the "mobs of the great
 13947	cities." It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he
 13948	accepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to
 13949	convince the constitution-makers of his own state. "It is not an idle
 13950	chimera of the brain," urged one of them, "that the possession of land
 13951	furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and
 13952	attachment to, the community.... It is upon this foundation I wish to
 13953	place the right of suffrage. This is the best general standard which can
 13954	be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be
 13955	invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,
 13956	consistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted
 13957	with the exercise of that right."
 13958	
 13959	=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of
 13960	American life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.
 13961	Prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business
 13962	interests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men
 13963	who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.
 13964	In New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred
 13965	pounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while
 13966	the landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,
 13967	therefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down
 13968	freehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were
 13969	interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from
 13970	public affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular
 13971	uprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders
 13972	to an end.
 13973	
 13974	In addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of
 13975	the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that
 13976	generally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not
 13977	numerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of
 13978	public affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned
 13979	King George's statue, and "crammed stamps down the throats of
 13980	collectors." When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively
 13981	interest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,
 13982	the "mechanicks in union" in New York protested against putting the new
 13983	state constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that
 13984	the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law
 13985	"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong." Though
 13986	their petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years
 13987	later, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched
 13988	the process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects
 13989	was to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.
 13990	During the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving
 13991	its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up
 13992	sentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for
 13993	members of the state conventions and so express their will directly.
 13994	After the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of
 13995	law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.
 13996	
 13997	Those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral
 13998	support in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men
 13999	are created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that
 14000	governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?
 14001	That doctrine was applied with effect to George III and seemed
 14002	appropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or
 14003	Virginia. "How do the principles thus proclaimed," asked the
 14004	non-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, "accord with
 14005	the existing regulation of the suffrage? A regulation which, instead of
 14006	the equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between
 14007	members of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in
 14008	consideration of their public services but of their private possessions,
 14009	the highest of all privileges."
 14010	
 14011	=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather
 14012	than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage
 14013	carry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or
 14014	shortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active
 14015	part in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force
 14016	the qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into
 14017	the union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year
 14018	Delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one
 14019	of the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of
 14020	manhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally
 14021	conservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.
 14022	
 14023	Five states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North
 14024	Carolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around
 14025	them; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in
 14026	Massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There
 14027	Webster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing
 14028	years of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations
 14029	as manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was
 14030	abolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York
 14031	surrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for
 14032	five years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.
 14033	Rhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of
 14034	agitation. Then Dorr's Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,
 14035	brought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying
 14036	qualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North
 14037	Carolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership
 14038	of land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until
 14039	1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for
 14040	office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of
 14041	manhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of
 14042	government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.
 14043	
 14044	[Illustration: THOMAS DORR AROUSING HIS FOLLOWERS]
 14045	
 14046	At the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white
 14047	male industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at
 14048	least, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the
 14049	free farmer a voice in the government of their common country.
 14050	"Universal democracy," sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United
 14051	States, "whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable
 14052	fact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct
 14053	or lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no
 14054	government is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America
 14055	with its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and
 14056	recompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere." Amid the
 14057	grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was
 14058	committed to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as
 14059	well as in the forests and fields of the West.
 14060	
 14061	
 14062	THE NEW DEMOCRACY ENTERS THE ARENA
 14063	
 14064	The spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the
 14065	machinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised
 14066	electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in
 14067	administration.
 14068	
 14069	=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted
 14070	office for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore
 14071	extended the system of rewarding party workers with government
 14072	positions--a system early established in several states, notably New
 14073	York and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of
 14074	fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in
 14075	personnel. "Long continuance in office," explained a champion of this
 14076	idea in Pennsylvania in 1837, "unfits a man for the discharge of its
 14077	duties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,
 14078	first life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the
 14079	destruction of free government." The solution offered was the historic
 14080	doctrine of "rotation in office." At the same time the principle of
 14081	popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who
 14082	had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even
 14083	geologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were
 14084	declared elective on the theory that their appointment "smacked of
 14085	monarchy."
 14086	
 14087	=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit
 14088	of democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state
 14089	government, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of
 14090	the Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on
 14091	any single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to
 14092	the discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,
 14093	greedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors
 14094	themselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,
 14095	thundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to
 14096	the people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular
 14097	election and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the
 14098	climax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,
 14099	New York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some
 14100	had experimented with popular election, still left the choice of
 14101	electors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone
 14102	held to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.
 14103	The fanciful idea of an electoral college of "good and wise men,"
 14104	selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as
 14105	deliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the
 14106	nation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of
 14107	democracy.
 14108	
 14109	=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the
 14110	popular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent
 14111	protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating
 14112	candidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and
 14113	the Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before
 14114	the election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election
 14115	caucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and
 14116	selected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In
 14117	a short time the practice of nominating by a "congressional caucus"
 14118	became a recognized institution. The election still remained with the
 14119	people; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed
 14120	into the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.
 14121	
 14122	
 14123	A reaction against this was unavoidable. To friends of "the plain
 14124	people," like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so
 14125	because the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More
 14126	conservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out
 14127	that, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an
 14128	independent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of
 14129	congressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained
 14130	by an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added
 14131	practical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the
 14132	place of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the
 14133	candidate, William H. Crawford, of Georgia, a man of distinction but no
 14134	great popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.
 14135	The followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of
 14136	the death of "King Caucus." Their clamor was effective. Under their
 14137	attacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.
 14138	
 14139	In place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating
 14140	convention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole
 14141	purpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were
 14142	still prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds
 14143	of delegates "fresh from the people," as Jackson was wont to say. In
 14144	fact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office
 14145	seekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as
 14146	King Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a
 14147	nomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly
 14148	established.
 14149	
 14150	=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the
 14151	representatives of the "aristocracy" made their last successful stand.
 14152	Until then the leadership by men of "wealth and talents" had been
 14153	undisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,
 14154	Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous
 14155	families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the
 14156	possession of life's refinements. None of them had ever been compelled
 14157	to work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been
 14158	slaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a
 14159	master of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,
 14160	notwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed
 14161	"with all the culture of his century." Monroe was a graduate of William
 14162	and Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three
 14163	successors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith
 14164	in the people but they were not "of the people" themselves; they were
 14165	not sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of "the grand
 14166	
 14167	old order of society" who gave finish and style even to popular
 14168	government.
 14169	
 14170	Monroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of
 14171	the Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the
 14172	Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity
 14173	after the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that
 14174	had wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With
 14175	his passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,
 14176	John Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that
 14177	he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.
 14178	Washington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry
 14179	and followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in
 14180	a duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive
 14181	in 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,
 14182	full of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined
 14183	to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification
 14184	proclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe
 14185	old age of eighty-five.
 14186	
 14187	=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked
 14188	the end of the "era of good feeling" inaugurated by the collapse of the
 14189	Federalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading
 14190	candidates, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and W.H.
 14191	Crawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral
 14192	votes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the
 14193	Constitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House
 14194	of Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his
 14195	weight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of
 14196	Jackson's friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that
 14197	inasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral
 14198	vote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and
 14199	make him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day
 14200	of the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.
 14201	
 14202	While Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of
 14203	"the rule of the people," he was regarded by Jackson's followers as "an
 14204	aristocrat." He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at
 14205	first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated
 14206	at Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he
 14207	was a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.
 14208	Moreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded
 14209	him as a man "born with a silver spoon in his mouth." Jackson's
 14210	supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero
 14211	entitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams
 14212	appointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a
 14213	cry that there had been a "deal" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams
 14214	to get office for himself.
 14215	
 14216	Though Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a
 14217	fine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition
 14218	which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in
 14219	the West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance
 14220	in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,
 14221	arts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in
 14222	against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By
 14223	signing the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the "Tariff of
 14224	Abominations," he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New
 14225	York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by
 14226	the false charge that he had been a party to a "corrupt bargain" with
 14227	Clay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high
 14228	protective tariff; charged with favoring an "aristocracy of
 14229	office-holders" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge
 14230	government clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White
 14231	House after he had served four years.
 14232	
 14233	=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the
 14234	presidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson
 14235	had in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in
 14236	the upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,
 14237	without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated
 14238	leisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American
 14239	democracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee
 14240	where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On
 14241	the march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their
 14242	hardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn
 14243	when nothing better could be found for the privates. From local
 14244	prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of
 14245	New Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the
 14246	feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The
 14247	farmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of
 14248	the Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their
 14249	friend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other
 14250	issues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily
 14251	elected President.
 14252	
 14253	The returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of
 14254	Jackson's power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from
 14255	Maine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in
 14256	Pennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond
 14257	the Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South
 14258	and West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.
 14259	
 14260	[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON]
 14261	
 14262	When Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of
 14263	the United States entered into a new era. Until this time the
 14264	inauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of
 14265	simplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the
 14266	capital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an
 14267	old-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to
 14268	the White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,
 14269	appointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the
 14270	long list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with
 14271	respectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,
 14272	men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great
 14273	throngs pressed into the White House, "upset the bowls of punch, broke
 14274	the glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered
 14275	chairs to see the people's President." If Jefferson's inauguration was,
 14276	as he called it, the "great revolution," Jackson's inauguration was a
 14277	cataclysm.
 14278	
 14279	
 14280	THE NEW DEMOCRACY AT WASHINGTON
 14281	
 14282	=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington
 14283	was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of
 14284	politics became "bad form" among fashionable women. The clerks and
 14285	civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure
 14286	of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.
 14287	Doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson
 14288	and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.
 14289	With a hunter's instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have
 14290	none but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old
 14291	employees to make room for men "fresh from the people." This was a new
 14292	custom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in
 14293	opposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to
 14294	choose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on
 14295	account of their political views and partisan activities.
 14296	
 14297	By wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party
 14298	grounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson
 14299	established the "spoils system" at Washington. The famous slogan, "to
 14300	the victor belong the spoils of victory," became the avowed principle of
 14301	the national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like
 14302	James Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government
 14303	suffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century
 14304	thereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its
 14305	predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any
 14306	one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications
 14307	for important public positions, he met Jackson's own profession of
 14308	faith: "The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being
 14309	made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them."
 14310	
 14311	=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power
 14312	very long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and
 14313	nationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a
 14314	matter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind
 14315	did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the
 14316	divided opinion of the country it was "good politics" to be vague and
 14317	ambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the
 14318	tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.
 14319	
 14320	_The Development of the Policy of "Protection."_--The war of 1812 and
 14321	the commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the
 14322	need for American economic independence. During that conflict, the
 14323	United States, cut off from English manufactures as during the
 14324	Revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,
 14325	steel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the
 14326	demands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang
 14327	up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in
 14328	industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the
 14329	government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying
 14330	American-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the
 14331	Americans, "their first war with England made them independent; their
 14332	second war made them formidable."
 14333	
 14334	In recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was
 14335	designed: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these "infant
 14336	industries" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon
 14337	American markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing
 14338	centers the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished
 14339	the purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces
 14340	so recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and
 14341	enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about
 14342	another very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of
 14343	New England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,
 14344	once friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.
 14345	
 14346	In the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their
 14347	energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from
 14348	America to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this
 14349	reason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase
 14350	domestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their
 14351	efforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon
 14352	they were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the
 14353	money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries
 14354	increased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.
 14355	Even the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,
 14356	began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests
 14357	of New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and
 14358	Pennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and
 14359	Tennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a
 14360	formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.
 14361	
 14362	_The Planting States Oppose the Tariff._--In the meantime, the cotton
 14363	states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the
 14364	Napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to
 14365	carry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton
 14366	had swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened
 14367	up. Cotton had in fact become "king" and the planters depended for their
 14368	prosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English
 14369	manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the
 14370	world. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except
 14371	farm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally
 14372	wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where
 14373	they sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the
 14374	price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid
 14375	on them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.
 14376	
 14377	_The Tariff of Abominations._--They were overborne, however, in 1824 and
 14378	again in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced
 14379	Congress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known
 14380	as "the Tariff of Abominations," though slightly modified in 1832, was
 14381	"the straw which broke the camel's back." Southern leaders turned in
 14382	rage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North
 14383	Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general
 14384	convention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance
 14385	against it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to
 14386	prevent its enforcement.
 14387	
 14388	_South Carolina Nullifies the Tariff._--The legislature of that state,
 14389	on October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which
 14390	duly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it
 14391	adopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days' debate.
 14392	Every line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,
 14393	gives "bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the
 14394	injury and oppression of other classes and individuals"; it is a
 14395	violation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null
 14396	and void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal
 14397	government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, "the
 14398	people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all
 14399	further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection
 14400	with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to
 14401	organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which
 14402	sovereign and independent states may of right do."
 14403	
 14404	_Southern States Condemn Nullification._--The answer of the country to
 14405	this note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky
 14406	resolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,
 14407	was quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while
 14408	condemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had
 14409	taken. Georgia responded: "We abhor the doctrine of nullification as
 14410	neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy." Alabama found it
 14411	"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice." North Carolina replied
 14412	that it was "revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution
 14413	of the United States." Mississippi answered: "It is disunion by
 14414	force--it is civil war." Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the
 14415	tariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but
 14416	denying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her
 14417	proceedings.
 14418	
 14419	_Jackson Firmly Upholds the Union._--The eyes of the country were turned
 14420	upon Andrew Jackson. It was known that he looked with no friendly
 14421	feelings upon nullification, for, at a Jefferson dinner in the spring of
 14422	1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness
 14423	announced a toast: "Our federal union; it must be preserved." When two
 14424	years later the open challenge came from South Carolina, he replied that
 14425	he would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: "If a
 14426	single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of
 14427	the United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hands on
 14428	engaged in such conduct upon the first tree that I can reach." He made
 14429	ready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval
 14430	forces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. Then in a
 14431	long and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he
 14432	pointed out the national character of the union, and announced his
 14433	solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification
 14434	he branded as "incompatible with the existence of the union,
 14435	contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized
 14436	by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was
 14437	founded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed."
 14438	
 14439	_A Compromise._--In his messages to Congress, however, Jackson spoke the
 14440	language of conciliation. A few days before issuing his proclamation he
 14441	suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic
 14442	manufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward
 14443	he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two
 14444	propositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South
 14445	Carolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,
 14446	Congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,
 14447	Henry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for
 14448	the gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the
 14449	level of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same
 14450	time the "force bill," designed to give the President ample authority in
 14451	executing the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but
 14452	acrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President
 14453	Jackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the
 14454	tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,
 14455	South Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying
 14456	the force bill.

 14460	DANIEL WEBSTER]
 14461	
 14462	_The Webster-Hayne Debate._--Where the actual victory lay in this
 14463	quarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.
 14464	Perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the
 14465	issue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the
 14466	principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down
 14467	their lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch
 14468	old Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,
 14469	spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of
 14470	nullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and
 14471	courtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in
 14472	January, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the
 14473	union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may
 14474	lawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena
 14475	Daniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle
 14476	of oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne
 14477	that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea
 14478	for the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the
 14479	union.
 14480	
 14481	=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of
 14482	nationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said
 14483	of his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every
 14484	true Jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the
 14485	administration of Jefferson's disciple, James Madison. It had not been
 14486	in operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,
 14487	especially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation
 14488	the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the
 14489	great anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making
 14490	loans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for
 14491	their support at Washington. To all Jackson's followers it was "an
 14492	insidious money power." One of them openly denounced it as an
 14493	institution designed "to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise
 14494	the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public
 14495	affairs."
 14496	
 14497	This sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to
 14498	Congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its
 14499	constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to
 14500	establish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was
 14501	necessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed
 14502	by the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges
 14503	by it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the
 14504	subject, leaving the decision, however, to "an enlightened people and
 14505	their representatives."
 14506	
 14507	Moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank
 14508	applied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years
 14509	before the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the
 14510	presidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the
 14511	application. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the
 14512	bill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.
 14513	His response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with
 14514	fury until the close of his second administration, ending in the
 14515	destruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.
 14516	
 14517	In his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and
 14518	even hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that
 14519	the Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the
 14520	decision in the McCulloch case. "Each public officer," he argued, "who
 14521	takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support
 14522	it as he understands it, not as it is understood by others."
 14523	
 14524	Not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,
 14525	Jackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government
 14526	deposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. This
 14527	action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money
 14528	shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The
 14529	Senate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had
 14530	"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the
 14531	Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both."
 14532	
 14533	The effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its
 14534	charter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control
 14535	of the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the
 14536	Supreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under
 14537	state ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this
 14538	in spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not
 14539	issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal
 14540	tender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by
 14541	paper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson
 14542	adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in
 14543	these banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which
 14544	supported him in politics--"pet banks," as they were styled at the
 14545	time. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of
 14546	the abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most
 14547	disastrous panics which it ever experienced.
 14548	
 14549	=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a
 14550	very clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so
 14551	simple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of
 14552	roads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored
 14553	government assistance in such matters, but his administration was
 14554	followed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress
 14555	appropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason
 14556	the argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,
 14557	puzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without
 14558	making the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might
 14559	lawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he
 14560	strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.
 14561	
 14562	=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson's reelection in 1832
 14563	served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the
 14564	people, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even
 14565	the courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of
 14566	peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of
 14567	federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a
 14568	sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and
 14569	the mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high
 14570	posts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring
 14571	rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of
 14572	friends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back
 14573	stairs arrangements, became known as "the kitchen cabinet." Under the
 14574	leadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos
 14575	Kendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried
 14576	out decrees and orders, communicating the President's lightest wish or
 14577	strictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and
 14578	in the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from
 14579	the United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary
 14580	conduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution
 14581	of condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was
 14582	able to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall
 14583	issued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,
 14584	according to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and
 14585	enforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally
 14586	even choosing his own successor.
 14587	
 14588	
 14589	THE RISE OF THE WHIGS
 14590	
 14591	=Jackson's Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies
 14592	so radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against
 14593	Jackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of
 14594	his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances
 14595	of the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which
 14596	existed under the Articles of Confederation. A paper currency, almost as
 14597	unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,
 14598	flooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use
 14599	of federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of
 14600	commodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive
 14601	vetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory
 14602	states to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states'
 14603	rights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to
 14604	sap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under
 14605	which the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of
 14606	Pennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had
 14607	flourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which
 14608	promised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson's
 14609	party, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly
 14610	chose for its title the term "Democrat," throwing down the gauntlet to
 14611	every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these
 14612	things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and
 14613	determined.
 14614	
 14615	[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON RIDICULING CLAY'S TARIFF AND INTERNAL
 14616	IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM]
 14617	
 14618	=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,
 14619	leadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel
 14620	Webster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted
 14621	by poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he
 14622	went from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he
 14623	rose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or
 14624	the martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social
 14625	habits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the
 14626	affections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and
 14627	Kentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.
 14628	He was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition
 14629	into union against Jackson.
 14630	
 14631	Around Clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every
 14632	species of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for "Old
 14633	Hickory." Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states' rights were
 14634	yoked with nationalists of Webster's school; ardent protectionists were
 14635	bound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one
 14636	grand confusion of ideas under the title of "National Republicans." Thus
 14637	the ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now
 14638	abandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the
 14639	supporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the
 14640	old Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal
 14641	improvements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive
 14642	tyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was
 14643	easily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have
 14644	given him some doubts about the faith of "the whole people" in the
 14645	wisdom of his "reign."
 14646	
 14647	=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General's
 14648	superb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on
 14649	selecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party
 14650	voters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated
 14651	Martin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by
 14652	carrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he
 14653	attended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the
 14654	applause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in
 14655	Tennessee.
 14656	
 14657	Fortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic
 14658	which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.
 14659	Among the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the
 14660	destruction of the bank and the issuance of the "specie circular" of
 14661	
 14662	1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in
 14663	coin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating
 14664	cause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns
 14665	in the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in
 14666	the industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.
 14667	Van Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance
 14668	to the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by
 14669	suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the
 14670	establishment of an independent treasury system, with government
 14671	depositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was
 14672	finally accepted by Congress in 1840.
 14673	
 14674	Had Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the
 14675	discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from
 14676	being a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he
 14677	owed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather
 14678	than to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care
 14679	for him. They suspected that he ate from "gold plate" and they could not
 14680	forgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the
 14681	Democratic party, remembering Jackson's wishes, renominated him
 14682	unanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.
 14683	
 14684	=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National
 14685	Republicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of
 14686	opposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a
 14687	leaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,
 14688	well known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal
 14689	improvements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man
 14690	of uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of
 14691	the Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a
 14692	battle more famous than important, "Tippecanoe"--a brush with the
 14693	Indians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy
 14694	services during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was
 14695	rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired
 14696	to quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was
 14697	held to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a
 14698	military hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he
 14699	rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man
 14700	accused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was
 14701	sufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a
 14702	platform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat
 14703	asserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of
 14704	hard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an
 14705	insult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson
 14706	men. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the
 14707	campaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van
 14708	Buren got only sixty.
 14709	
 14710	=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the
 14711	fruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended
 14712	upon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if
 14713	he stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.
 14714	He was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his
 14715	inauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell
 14716	mortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.
 14717	
 14718	Harrison's successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had
 14719	nominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than
 14720	anything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The
 14721	Whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another
 14722	United States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until
 14723	near the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had
 14724	declared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,
 14725	marked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.
 14726	The Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist
 14727	Democrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise
 14728	which had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in
 14729	the days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel
 14730	Webster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton
 14731	representing Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between
 14732	the two countries over the Maine boundary. A year after closing this
 14733	chapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving
 14734	the President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.
 14735	
 14736	To the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but
 14737	the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They
 14738	had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable
 14739	to Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning
 14740	with the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them
 14741	and, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in
 14742	public life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the
 14743	Southern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving
 14744	a new cause--slavery--was returned to power under James K. Polk, a
 14745	friend of the General from Tennessee. A few grains of sand were to run
 14746	through the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and
 14747	scattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.
 14748	
 14749	
 14750	THE INTERACTION OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OPINION
 14751	
 14752	=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian
 14753	Democracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation
 14754	between the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the
 14755	successes of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of
 14756	overthrowing the aristocracy which George III had manipulated with such
 14757	effect against America half a century before. In the United States, on
 14758	the other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent
 14759	of manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working
 14760	classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in
 14761	the government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion
 14762	went epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson's second
 14763	triumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which
 14764	conferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and
 14765	shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial
 14766	step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed
 14767	aristocracy and the rich merchants of England.
 14768	
 14769	About the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon
 14770	family, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after
 14771	their victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of
 14772	arbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned
 14773	nothing and forgotten nothing. Charles X, who came to the throne in
 14774	1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French
 14775	Revolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the
 14776	clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered
 14777	equally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular
 14778	party, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as
 14779	some of the radicals had hoped, but a "liberal" middle-class monarchy
 14780	under Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound
 14781	impression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving
 14782	toward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City
 14783	joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled
 14784	with cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for "the people's
 14785	own, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United
 14786	States!"
 14787	
 14788	=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled
 14789	Europeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or
 14790	an inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with
 14791	optimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was
 14792	rising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country
 14793	that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which
 14794	to find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make
 14795	experiments of the same character.
 14796	
 14797	=De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual
 14798	traveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer
 14799	bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the
 14800	wilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular
 14801	forces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of
 14802	many blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's
 14803	rule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French
 14804	liberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country
 14805	in 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in
 14806	America_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was
 14807	convinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the
 14808	American people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the
 14809	nation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was
 14810	both inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful
 14811	contrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what
 14812	proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that
 14813	through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all
 14814	arts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,
 14815	devoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of
 14816	life and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave
 14817	deep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a
 14818	necessary virtue in the republic. "Amongst a democratic people where
 14819	there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has
 14820	worked, or is born of parents who have worked. A notion of labor is
 14821	therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,
 14822	and honest condition of human existence." It was this notion of a
 14823	government in the hands of people who labored that struck the French
 14824	publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.
 14825	
 14826	=Harriet Martineau's Visit to America.=--This phase of American life
 14827	also profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet
 14828	Martineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and
 14829	the log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal
 14830	boats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions
 14831	at slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the
 14832	thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the
 14833	people in one great political body. "However various may be the tribes
 14834	of inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been
 14835	their birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their
 14836	language, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or
 14837	despised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal
 14838	political obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to
 14839	have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be
 14840	bound in equal duty to watch their workings." Miss Martineau was also
 14841	impressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and
 14842	contrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of
 14843	the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.
 14844	
 14845	=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were
 14846	convinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.
 14847	Trollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,
 14848	saw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the
 14849	"total and universal want of manners both in males and females," adding
 14850	that while "they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,"
 14851	there was "no charm, no grace in their conversation." She found
 14852	everywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other
 14853	critics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_
 14854	petulantly exclaimed that the United States was "a brigand
 14855	confederation." Charles Dickens declared the country to be "so maimed
 14856	and lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from
 14857	the loathsome creature in disgust." Sydney Smith, editor of the
 14858	_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the
 14859	expense of America. "Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other
 14860	sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the
 14861	king of England," he observed in 1820. "During the thirty or forty
 14862	years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the
 14863	sciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike
 14864	studies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the
 14865	globe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks
 14866	at an American picture or statue?" To put a sharp sting into his taunt
 14867	he added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and
 14868	fostered: "Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is
 14869	every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?"
 14870	
 14871	Some Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial
 14872	judgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took
 14873	thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against
 14874	them. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,
 14875	gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the
 14876	achievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in
 14877	America than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.

 14971	THE MIDDLE BORDER AND THE GREAT WEST
 14972	
 14973	
 14974	"We shall not send an emigrant beyond the Mississippi in a hundred
 14975	years," exclaimed Livingston, the principal author of the Louisiana
 14976	purchase. When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had
 14977	before his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between
 14978	the Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history
 14979	of the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to
 14980	settle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem
 14981	far wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond
 14982	the Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico
 14983	to the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the
 14984	Pacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of
 14985	California.
 14986	
 14987	
 14988	THE ADVANCE OF THE MIDDLE BORDER
 14989	
 14990	=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,
 14991	the Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had
 14992	crossed during Washington's administration "to escape from civilization"
 14993	in Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of
 14994	population of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,
 14995	with its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well
 14996	adapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters
 14997	from the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as
 14998	from Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21
 14999	admitted her to the union, wearing "every jewel of sovereignty," as a
 15000	florid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their
 15001	property would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the
 15002	Mississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of
 15003	the state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.
 15004	In the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a
 15005	fourth of the population.
 15006	
 15007	Into this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another
 15008	current of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and
 15009	Mississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and
 15010	consolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the
 15011	East and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the
 15012	southwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by
 15013	their own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above
 15014	five or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,
 15015	enriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of
 15016	the river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its
 15017	seventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand
 15018	foreigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the
 15019	largest single element.
 15020	
 15021	=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had
 15022	long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless
 15023	frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In
 15024	search of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and
 15025	a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the
 15026	territory in an unending drift, "squatting" on the land. Without so much
 15027	as asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they
 15028	claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.
 15029	Like the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very
 15030	customs and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days
 15031	in the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of
 15032	the flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the
 15033	restrictions of civilized life.
 15034	
 15035	Unfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi
 15036	and Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco
 15037	and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The
 15038	newcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley
 15039	toward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.
 15040	In time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from
 15041	thirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of
 15042	the small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting
 15043	politics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of
 15044	admission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.
 15045	
 15046	=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state
 15047	was admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people
 15048	of Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced
 15049	that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a
 15050	commonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied
 15051	largely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and
 15052	adopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of
 15053	the old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing
 15054	city as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,
 15055	and freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there
 15056	were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was
 15057	not without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as
 15058	ever with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to
 15059	restrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,
 15060	and started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The
 15061	hand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new
 15062	constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white
 15063	males, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were
 15064	overborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though
 15065	shorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.
 15066	
 15067	=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of
 15068	Wisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the
 15069	Northwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and
 15070	missionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis
 15071	XIV. It will not be forgotten that the French rangers of the woods, the
 15072	black-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers
 15073	of the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and
 15074	Menard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the
 15075	northern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests
 15076	and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little
 15077	villages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint
 15078	journeyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the
 15079	soldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal
 15080	against the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag
 15081	was planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two
 15082	years later to overthrow British dominion.
 15083	
 15084	When, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union
 15085	Jack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.
 15086	They were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle
 15087	royal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through
 15088	forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over
 15089	portages for the settlers and their families from the states "back
 15090	East." It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later
 15091	used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm
 15092	lands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came
 15093	miners from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the
 15094	lead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their
 15095	claims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the
 15096	wielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have
 15097	taken high rank among the mining regions of the country.
 15098	
 15099	From a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of
 15100	Milwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry
 15101	for Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand
 15102	inhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.
 15103	Already the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into
 15104	the territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing
 15105	forests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting
 15106	mills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes
 15107	for the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.
 15108	
 15109	=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the
 15110	Mississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,
 15111	farmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for
 15112	statehood. A tide of immigration that might have flowed into Missouri
 15113	went northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,
 15114	preferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible
 15115	swiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee
 15116	ingenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836
 15117	three prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.
 15118	True to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that
 15119	religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the
 15120	states from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans
 15121	laid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in
 15122	1846.
 15123	
 15124	Above Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home
 15125	of the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and
 15126	Wisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the
 15127	first white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the
 15128	people of the United States, the resources of the country were first
 15129	revealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American
 15130	fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply
 15131	their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an
 15132	American settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost
 15133	of advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting
 15134	a population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the
 15135	plea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by
 15136	being first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of
 15137	peril.
 15138	
 15139	
 15140	ON TO THE PACIFIC--TEXAS AND THE MEXICAN WAR
 15141	
 15142	=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about
 15143	pioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long
 15144	stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid
 15145	out like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,
 15146	or more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking
 15147	uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading
 15148	far and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved
 15149	the sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity
 15150	were there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in
 15151	old missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering
 15152	blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The
 15153	population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in
 15154	severe and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding
 15155	swamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same
 15156	rotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock
 15157	into whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German
 15158	immigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch
 15159	oven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,
 15160	despair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of
 15161	prosaic sameness.
 15162	
 15163	[Illustration: SANTA BARBARA MISSION]
 15164	
 15165	=A Contrast in the Far West and Southwest.=--As George Rogers Clark and
 15166	Daniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek
 15167	their fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,
 15168	Sam Houston, Davy Crockett, and John C. Fremont were to lead the way
 15169	into a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The
 15170	setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a
 15171	wide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the
 15172	Rio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and
 15173	the Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region
 15174	presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could
 15175	foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with
 15176	the older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass
 15177	region of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted
 15178	desert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of
 15179	Iowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the
 15180	horizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless
 15181	summer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of
 15182	San Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of
 15183	Delaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!
 15184	And scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient
 15185	civilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,
 15186	aqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples
 15187	who, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and
 15188	lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the
 15189	plain.
 15190	
 15191	The settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins
 15192	and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of
 15193	English, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern
 15194	states. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the
 15195	first time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes
 15196	on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others
 15197	were to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas
 15198	planters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage
 15199	drivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, "lumber
 15200	jacks," and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for
 15201	the self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand
 15202	settlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout
 15203	for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.
 15204	Statehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right
 15205	to dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest
 15206	for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,
 15207	each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of
 15208	a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the "right
 15209	political persuasion," to use the current phrase.
 15210	
 15211	=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the
 15212	broad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently
 15213	in endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.
 15214	Ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin
 15215	soil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly
 15216	reached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a
 15217	moment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on
 15218	and the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more
 15219	than generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a
 15220	"peaceful penetration," the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the
 15221	doors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed
 15222	to bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the
 15223	person of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the
 15224	Southwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans
 15225	near Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son
 15226	and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of
 15227	Texas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the
 15228	border.
 15229	
 15230	=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to
 15231	such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in
 15232	dismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the
 15233	Americans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when
 15234	efforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the
 15235	United States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped
 15236	all American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put
 15237	a tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers
 15238	were raised too late. A call for help ran through the western border of
 15239	the United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy
 15240	Crockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;
 15241	James Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears
 15242	his name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of
 15243	their countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,
 15244	impatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it
 15245	known that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own
 15246	masters.
 15247	
 15248	=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth
 15249	of the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836
 15250	and summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their
 15251	ancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by
 15252	Americans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of
 15253	Mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they
 15254	dispatched a force to repel "the invading army," as General Houston
 15255	called the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican
 15256	president. A portion of the Texan soldiers took their stand in the
 15257	Alamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San
 15258	Antonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,
 15259	they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off
 15260	from all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the
 15261	last man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within
 15262	three months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,
 15263	taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the
 15264	restoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.
 15265	
 15266	The Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission
 15267	to the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was
 15268	required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the
 15269	union. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had
 15270	a warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough
 15271	and ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an
 15272	American representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously
 15273	labored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the
 15274	cession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into
 15275	their own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the
 15276	approval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of
 15277	annexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the
 15278	issue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her
 15279	future.
 15280	
 15281	=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the
 15282	opposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators
 15283	could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.
 15284	"Texas," exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, "is but the first step
 15285	of aggression. I trust indeed that Providence will beat back and humble
 15286	our cupidity and ambition. I now ask whether as a people we are
 15287	prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending
 15288	slavery? I ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of
 15289	God, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner
 15290	perish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!"
 15291	William Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states
 15292	if Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams
 15293	warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the
 15294	imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and
 15295	destruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into
 15296	account changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state
 15297	of New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of
 15298	annexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the
 15299	"Reannexation of Texas," based on claims which the United States once
 15300	had to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.
 15301	
 15302	=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van
 15303	Buren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue
 15304	of annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange
 15305	fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind
 15306	firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter
 15307	rest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened
 15308	with favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a
 15309	convincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the
 15310	Constitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the
 15311	preservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South
 15312	as against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and
 15313	population. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the
 15314	office of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the
 15315	treaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was
 15316	blocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be
 15317	secured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a
 15318	joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,
 15319	and in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,
 15320	they pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and
 15321	the hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.
 15322	
 15323	[Illustration: TEXAS AND THE TERRITORY IN DISPUTE]
 15324	
 15325	=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the
 15326	abolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause
 15327	being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed
 15328	all the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of
 15329	Texas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly
 15330	direction. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,
 15331	ordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of
 15332	American sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an
 15333	invasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.
 15334	
 15335	President Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that
 15336	American blood had been "spilled on American soil" and that war existed
 15337	"by the act of Mexico." Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,
 15338	brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the
 15339	government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and
 15340	supplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of
 15341	Representatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,
 15342	accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All
 15343	through the South and the West the war was popular. New England
 15344	grumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict
 15345	precipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm
 15346	objectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung
 15347	scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.
 15348	
 15349	=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.
 15350	General Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern
 15351	Mexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up
 15352	another military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided
 15353	to divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the
 15354	capital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two
 15355	heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a
 15356	third candidate was made, John C. Fremont, who, in cooperation with
 15357	Commodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and
 15358	Stripes on the Pacific slope.
 15359	
 15360	In February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor
 15361	California, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent
 15362	than the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,
 15363	the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the
 15364	cancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,
 15365	through the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands
 15366	along the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on
 15367	payment of ten million dollars.
 15368	
 15369	=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the
 15370	treaty that closed the war before "rough and ready" General Taylor, a
 15371	slave owner from Louisiana, "a Whig," as he said, "but not an ultra
 15372	Whig," was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself
 15373	had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.
 15374	The tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent
 15375	gesture he referred to the people's representatives in Congress,
 15376	offering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay's followers
 15377	mourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands
 15378	of the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,
 15379	celebrated for his laconic order, "Give 'em a little more grape, Captain
 15380	Bragg," became President of the United States.
 15381	
 15382	
 15383	THE PACIFIC COAST AND UTAH
 15384	
 15385	=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about
 15386	the affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the
 15387	possession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of
 15388	1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, "The Reannexation of
 15389	Texas," two other cries, "The Reoccupation of Oregon," and "Fifty-four
 15390	Forty or Fight." The last two slogans were founded on American
 15391	discoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in
 15392	politics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New
 15393	England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from
 15394	the nation the attention which its importance warranted.
 15395	
 15396	_Joint Occupation and Settlement._--Both England and the United States
 15397	had long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the
 15398	territory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an
 15399	indefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free
 15400	to hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur
 15401	traders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with
 15402	Americans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New
 15403	York merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading
 15404	post at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American
 15405	missionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus
 15406	Whitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.
 15407	
 15408	Through news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers
 15409	heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;
 15410	those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the
 15411	new country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a
 15412	great expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed
 15413	rapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the
 15414	pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. "We,
 15415	the people of Oregon territory," runs the preamble to their compact,
 15416	"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and
 15417	prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and
 15418	regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their
 15419	jurisdiction over us." Thus self-government made its way across the
 15420	Rocky Mountains.
 15421	
 15422	[Illustration: THE OREGON COUNTRY AND THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY]
 15423	
 15424	_The Boundary Dispute with England Adjusted._--By this time it was
 15425	evident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the
 15426	question an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,
 15427	pressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address
 15428	and his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the
 15429	Democratic platform that "our title to the whole territory of Oregon is
 15430	clear and unquestionable." This pretension Great Britain firmly
 15431	rejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.
 15432	
 15433	Polk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and
 15434	obtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the
 15435	American minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at
 15436	the forty-ninth parallel instead of "fifty-four forty," and give it
 15437	Vancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.
 15438	Instead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a
 15439	treaty, he turned to the Senate for "counsel." As prearranged with party
 15440	leaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in
 15441	1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. "Oh!
 15442	mountain that was delivered of a mouse," exclaimed Senator Benton, "thy
 15443	name shall be fifty-four forty!" Thirteen years later, the southern part
 15444	of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,
 15445	leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.
 15446	
 15447	=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by
 15448	nature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had
 15449	fortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this
 15450	huge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile
 15451	soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend
 15452	their sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than
 15453	155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of
 15454	Delaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if
 15455	that became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.
 15456	
 15457	_Early American Relations with California._--Time and tide, it seems,
 15458	were not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far
 15459	different type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever
 15460	dreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been
 15461	around the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors
 15462	with a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to
 15463	California, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and
 15464	leaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval
 15465	stores, and rum in their wake. "Home from Californy!" rang the cry in
 15466	many a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his
 15467	return from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.
 15468	
 15469	[Illustration: THE OVERLAND TRAILS]
 15470	
 15471	_The Overland Trails._--Not to be outdone by the mariners of the deep,
 15472	western scouts searched for overland routes to the Pacific. Zebulon
 15473	Pike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the Southwest
 15474	during Jefferson's administration, had discovered the resources of New
 15475	Spain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach Santa Fe
 15476	from the upper waters of the Arkansas River. Not long afterward, traders
 15477	laid open the route, making Franklin, Missouri, and later Fort
 15478	Leavenworth the starting point. Along the trail, once surveyed, poured
 15479	caravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding Indians. Sand
 15480	storms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did
 15481	many a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the
 15482	profits at the end kept the business thriving. Huge stocks of cottons,
 15483	glass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent
 15484	to be exchanged at Santa Fe for furs, Indian blankets, silver, and
 15485	mules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.
 15486	
 15487	_Americans in California._--Why stop at Santa Fe? The question did not
 15488	long remain unanswered. In 1829, Ewing Young broke the path to Los
 15489	Angeles. Thirteen years later Fremont made the first of his celebrated
 15490	expeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of
 15491	the entire country in the Far West. In the wake of the pathfinders went
 15492	adventurers, settlers, and artisans. By 1847, more than one-fifth of the
 15493	inhabitants in the little post of two thousand on San Francisco Bay were
 15494	from the United States. The Mexican War, therefore, was not the
 15495	beginning but the end of the American conquest of California--a conquest
 15496	initiated by Americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow
 15497	some mechanical pursuit.
 15498	
 15499	_The Discovery of Gold._--As if to clinch the hold on California already
 15500	secured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden
 15501	discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in the Sacramento Valley. When this
 15502	exciting news reached the East, a mighty rush began to California, over
 15503	the trails, across the Isthmus of Panama, and around Cape Horn. Before
 15504	two years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in
 15505	search of fortunes, had arrived in California--mechanics, teachers,
 15506	doctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of
 15507	the earth.
 15508

 15511	SAN FRANCISCO IN 1849]
 15512	
 15513	_California a Free State._--With this increase in population there
 15514	naturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union. Instead
 15515	of waiting for authority from Washington, the Californians held a
 15516	convention in 1849 and framed their constitution. With impatience, the
 15517	delegates brushed aside the plea that "the balance of power between the
 15518	North and South" required the admission of their state as a slave
 15519	commonwealth. Without a dissenting voice, they voted in favor of freedom
 15520	and boldly made their request for inclusion among the United States.
 15521	President Taylor, though a Southern man, advised Congress to admit the
 15522	applicant. Robert Toombs of Georgia vowed to God that he preferred
 15523	secession. Henry Clay, the great compromiser, came to the rescue and in
 15524	1850 California was admitted as a free state.
 15525	
 15526	=Utah.=--On the long road to California, in the midst of forbidding and
 15527	barren wastes, a religious sect, the Mormons, had planted a colony
 15528	destined to a stormy career. Founded in 1830 under the leadership of
 15529	Joseph Smith of New York, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets
 15530	of fortune. From Ohio they had migrated into Missouri where they were
 15531	set upon and beaten. Some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.
 15532	Harried out of Missouri, they went into Illinois only to see their
 15533	director and prophet, Smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and
 15534	then shot by a mob. Having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of
 15535	both their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have
 15536	more than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new
 15537	leader, Brigham Young, that they go into the Far West beyond the plains
 15538	of Kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from
 15539	troubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the Bible. In
 15540	1847, Young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until
 15541	he found a suitable spot overlooking the Salt Lake Valley. Returning to
 15542	Illinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,
 15543	and in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.
 15544	
 15545	_Brigham Young and His Economic System._--In Brigham Young the Mormons
 15546	had a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of
 15547	the arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of
 15548	industry. He promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and
 15549	verily he did it. He firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along
 15550	co-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one
 15551	hand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.
 15552	With the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw
 15553	the line between public and private interest. Land was given outright to
 15554	each family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that
 15555	none should have great advantage over another. The purchase of supplies
 15556	and the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store, the
 15557	profits of which went to the common good. Encountering for the first
 15558	time in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race the problem of aridity, the
 15559	Mormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.
 15560	They built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water
 15561	rights to all families on equitable terms.
 15562	
 15563	_The Growth of Industries._--Though farming long remained the major
 15564	interest of the colony, the Mormons, eager to be self-supporting in
 15565	every possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later
 15566	to mining. Their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of
 15567	Europe for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of
 15568	the sect. "We want," proclaimed President Young to all the earth, "a
 15569	company of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool
 15570	from the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. We want a company
 15571	of potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... We
 15572	want some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders
 15573	are waiting.... We have a printing press and any one who can take good
 15574	printing and writing paper to the Valley will be a blessing to
 15575	themselves and the church." Roads and bridges were built; millions were
 15576	spent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a
 15577	huge cost were maintained in the East and in Europe; an army was kept
 15578	for defense against the Indians; and colonies were planted in the
 15579	outlying regions. A historian of Deseret, as the colony was called by
 15580	the Mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the
 15581	people had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the
 15582	coming of the vanguard.
 15583	
 15584	_Polygamy Forbidden._--The hope of the Mormons that they might forever
 15585	remain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds
 15586	of farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to
 15587	settle among them. In 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous
 15588	that it was organized into a territory of the United States and brought
 15589	under the supervision of the federal government. Protests against
 15590	polygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three
 15591	thousand miles away at Washington. The new Republican party in 1856
 15592	proclaimed it "the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the
 15593	Territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery." In
 15594	due time the Mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were
 15595	condemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they
 15596	kept their religious faith. Monuments to their early enterprise are seen
 15597	in the Temple and the Tabernacle, the irrigation works, and the great
 15598	wealth of the Church.
 15599	
 15600	
 15601	SUMMARY OF WESTERN DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS
 15602	
 15603	While the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of
 15604	their age, hunters, pioneers, and home seekers were preparing new
 15605	problems beyond the Alleghanies. The West was rising in population and
 15606	wealth. Between 1783 and 1829, eleven states were added to the original
 15607	thirteen. All but two were in the West. Two of them were in the
 15608	Louisiana territory beyond the Mississippi. Here the process of
 15609	colonization was repeated. Hardy frontier people cut down the forests,
 15610	built log cabins, laid out farms, and cut roads through the wilderness.
 15611	They began a new civilization just as the immigrants to Virginia or
 15612	Massachusetts had done two centuries earlier.
 15613	
 15614	Like the seaboard colonists before them, they too cherished the spirit
 15615	of independence and power. They had not gone far upon their course
 15616	before they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the East. In 1829
 15617	they actually sent one of their own cherished leaders, Andrew Jackson,
 15618	to the White House. Again in 1840, in 1844, in 1848, and in 1860, the
 15619	Mississippi Valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for
 15620	the seat of power at Washington. Its democratic temper evoked a cordial
 15621	response in the towns of the East where the old aristocracy had been put
 15622	aside and artisans had been given the ballot.
 15623	
 15624	For three decades the West occupied the interest of the nation. Under
 15625	Jackson's leadership, it destroyed the second United States Bank. When
 15626	he smote nullification in South Carolina, it gave him cordial support.
 15627	It approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party
 15628	workers--"the spoils system" in all its fullness. On only one point did
 15629	it really dissent. The West heartily favored internal improvements, the
 15630	appropriation of federal funds for highways, canals, and railways.
 15631	Jackson had misgivings on this question and awakened sharp criticism by
 15632	vetoing a road improvement bill.
 15633	
 15634	From their point of vantage on the frontier, the pioneers pressed on
 15635	westward. They pushed into Texas, created a state, declared their
 15636	independence, demanded a place in the union, and precipitated a war with
 15637	Mexico. They crossed the trackless plain and desert, laying out trails
 15638	to Santa Fe, to Oregon, and to California. They were upon the scene when
 15639	the Mexican War brought California under the Stars and Stripes. They had
 15640	laid out their farms in the Willamette Valley when the slogan
 15641	"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight" forced a settlement of the Oregon boundary.
 15642	California and Oregon were already in the union when there arose the
 15643	Great Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived
 15644	and so dedicated could long endure.

 15733	CHAPTER XIII
 15734	
 15735	THE RISE OF THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM
 15736	
 15737	
 15738	If Jefferson could have lived to see the Stars and Stripes planted on
 15739	the Pacific Coast, the broad empire of Texas added to the planting
 15740	states, and the valley of the Willamette waving with wheat sown by
 15741	farmers from New England, he would have been more than fortified in his
 15742	faith that the future of America lay in agriculture. Even a stanch old
 15743	Federalist like Gouverneur Morris or Josiah Quincy would have mournfully
 15744	conceded both the prophecy and the claim. Manifest destiny never seemed
 15745	more clearly written in the stars.
 15746	
 15747	As the farmers from the Northwest and planters from the Southwest poured
 15748	in upon the floor of Congress, the party of Jefferson, christened anew
 15749	by Jackson, grew stronger year by year. Opponents there were, no doubt,
 15750	disgruntled critics and Whigs by conviction; but in 1852 Franklin
 15751	Pierce, the Democratic candidate for President, carried every state in
 15752	the union except Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This
 15753	victory, a triumph under ordinary circumstances, was all the more
 15754	significant in that Pierce was pitted against a hero of the Mexican War,
 15755	General Scott, whom the Whigs, hoping to win by rousing the martial
 15756	ardor of the voters, had nominated. On looking at the election returns,
 15757	the new President calmly assured the planters that "the general
 15758	principle of reduction of duties with a view to revenue may now be
 15759	regarded as the settled policy of the country." With equal confidence,
 15760	he waved aside those agitators who devoted themselves "to the supposed
 15761	interests of the relatively few Africans in the United States." Like a
 15762	watchman in the night he called to the country: "All's well."
 15763	
 15764	The party of Hamilton and Clay lay in the dust.
 15765	
 15766	
 15767	THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
 15768	
 15769	As pride often goeth before a fall, so sanguine expectation is sometimes
 15770	the symbol of defeat. Jackson destroyed the bank. Polk signed the tariff
 15771	bill of 1846 striking an effective blow at the principle of protection
 15772	for manufactures. Pierce promised to silence the abolitionists. His
 15773	successor was to approve a drastic step in the direction of free trade.
 15774	Nevertheless all these things left untouched the springs of power that
 15775	were in due time to make America the greatest industrial nation on the
 15776	earth; namely, vast national resources, business enterprise, inventive
 15777	genius, and the free labor supply of Europe. Unseen by the thoughtless,
 15778	unrecorded in the diaries of wiseacres, rarely mentioned in the speeches
 15779	of statesmen, there was swiftly rising such a tide in the affairs of
 15780	America as Jefferson and Hamilton never dreamed of in their little
 15781	philosophies.
 15782	
 15783	=The Inventors.=--Watt and Boulton experimenting with steam in England,
 15784	Whitney combining wood and steel into a cotton gin, Fulton and Fitch
 15785	applying the steam engine to navigation, Stevens and Peter Cooper trying
 15786	out the "iron horse" on "iron highways," Slater building spinning mills
 15787	in Pawtucket, Howe attaching the needle to the flying wheel, Morse
 15788	spanning a continent with the telegraph, Cyrus Field linking the markets
 15789	of the new world with the old along the bed of the Atlantic, McCormick
 15790	breaking the sickle under the reaper--these men and a thousand more were
 15791	destroying in a mighty revolution of industry the world of the
 15792	stagecoach and the tallow candle which Washington and Franklin had
 15793	inherited little changed from the age of Caesar. Whitney was to make
 15794	cotton king. Watt and Fulton were to make steel and steam masters of the
 15795	world. Agriculture was to fall behind in the race for supremacy.
 15796	
 15797	=Industry Outstrips Planting.=--The story of invention, that tribute to
 15798	the triumph of mind over matter, fascinating as a romance, need not be
 15799	treated in detail here. The effects of invention on social and political
 15800	life, multitudinous and never-ending, form the very warp and woof of
 15801	American progress from the days of Andrew Jackson to the latest hour.
 15802	Neither the great civil conflict--the clash of two systems--nor the
 15803	problems of the modern age can be approached without an understanding of
 15804	the striking phases of industrialism.
 15805	
 15806	[Illustration: A NEW ENGLAND MILL BUILT IN 1793]
 15807	
 15808	First and foremost among them was the uprush of mills managed by
 15809	captains of industry and manned by labor drawn from farms, cities, and
 15810	foreign lands. For every planter who cleared a domain in the Southwest
 15811	and gathered his army of bondmen about him, there rose in the North a
 15812	magician of steam and steel who collected under his roof an army of free
 15813	workers.
 15814	
 15815	In seven league boots this new giant strode ahead of the Southern giant.
 15816	Between 1850 and 1859, to use dollars and cents as the measure of
 15817	progress, the value of domestic manufactures including mines and
 15818	fisheries rose from $1,019,106,616 to $1,900,000,000, an increase of
 15819	eighty-six per cent in ten years. In this same period the total
 15820	production of naval stores, rice, sugar, tobacco, and cotton, the
 15821	staples of the South, went only from $165,000,000, in round figures, to
 15822	$204,000,000. At the halfway point of the century, the capital invested
 15823	in industry, commerce, and cities far exceeded the value of all the farm
 15824	land between the Atlantic and the Pacific; thus the course of economy
 15825	had been reversed in fifty years. Tested by figures of production, King
 15826	Cotton had shriveled by 1860 to a petty prince in comparison, for each
 15827	year the captains of industry turned out goods worth nearly twenty times
 15828	all the bales of cotton picked on Southern plantations. Iron, boots and
 15829	shoes, and leather goods pouring from Northern mills surpassed in value
 15830	the entire cotton output.
 15831	
 15832	=The Agrarian West Turns to Industry.=--Nor was this vast enterprise
 15833	confined to the old Northeast where, as Madison had sagely remarked,
 15834	commerce was early dominant. "Cincinnati," runs an official report in
 15835	1854, "appears to be a great central depot for ready-made clothing and
 15836	its manufacture for the Western markets may be said to be one of the
 15837	great trades of that city." There, wrote another traveler, "I heard the
 15838	crack of the cattle driver's whip and the hum of the factory: the West
 15839	and the East meeting." Louisville and St. Louis were already famous for
 15840	their clothing trades and the manufacture of cotton bagging. Five
 15841	hundred of the two thousand woolen mills in the country in 1860 were in
 15842	the Western states. Of the output of flour and grist mills, which almost
 15843	reached in value the cotton crop of 1850, the Ohio Valley furnished a
 15844	rapidly growing share. The old home of Jacksonian democracy, where
 15845	Federalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists, turned slowly
 15846	backward, as the needle to the pole, toward the principle of protection
 15847	for domestic industry, espoused by Hamilton and defended by Clay.
 15848	
 15849	=The Extension of Canals and Railways.=--As necessary to mechanical
 15850	industry as steel and steam power was the great market, spread over a
 15851	wide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of
 15852	transportation. This service was supplied to industry by the steamship,
 15853	which began its career on the Hudson in 1807; by the canals, of which
 15854	the Erie opened in 1825 was the most noteworthy; and by the railways,
 15855	which came into practical operation about 1830.
 15856	
 15857	[Illustration: _From an old print_
 15858	
 15859	AN EARLY RAILWAY]
 15860	
 15861	With sure instinct the Eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets
 15862	of the Northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually
 15863	staggering crops of corn, wheat, bacon, and wool. The two great canal
 15864	systems--the Erie connecting New York City with the waterways of the
 15865	Great Lakes and the Pennsylvania chain linking Philadelphia with the
 15866	headwaters of the Ohio--gradually turned the tide of trade from New
 15867	Orleans to the Eastern seaboard. The railways followed the same paths.
 15868	By 1860, New York had rail connections with Chicago and St. Louis, one
 15869	of the routes running through the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and along
 15870	the Great Lakes, the other through Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and
 15871	across the rich wheat fields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Baltimore,
 15872	not to be outdone by her two rivals, reached out over the mountains for
 15873	the Western trade and in 1857 had trains running into St. Louis.
 15874	
 15875	In railway enterprise the South took more interest than in canals, and
 15876	the friends of that section came to its aid. To offset the magnet
 15877	drawing trade away from the Mississippi Valley, lines were built from
 15878	the Gulf to Chicago, the Illinois Central part of the project being a
 15879	monument to the zeal and industry of a Democrat, better known in
 15880	politics than in business, Stephen A. Douglas. The swift movement of
 15881	cotton and tobacco to the North or to seaports was of common concern to
 15882	planters and manufacturers. Accordingly lines were flung down along the
 15883	Southern coast, linking Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah with the
 15884	Northern markets. Other lines struck inland from the coast, giving a
 15885	rail outlet to the sea for Raleigh, Columbia, Atlanta, Chattanooga,
 15886	Nashville, and Montgomery. Nevertheless, in spite of this enterprise,
 15887	the mileage of all the Southern states in 1860 did not equal that of
 15888	Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois combined.
 15889	
 15890	=Banking and Finance.=--Out of commerce and manufactures and the
 15891	construction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of
 15892	capital in the Northern states as merchants of old never imagined. The
 15893	banks of the four industrial states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New
 15894	York, and Pennsylvania in 1860 had funds greater than the banks in all
 15895	the other states combined. New York City had become the money market of
 15896	America, the center to which industrial companies, railway promoters,
 15897	farmers, and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their
 15898	operations. The banks of Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, and
 15899	Virginia, it is true, had capital far in excess of the banks of the
 15900	Northwest; but still they were relatively small compared with the
 15901	financial institutions of the East.
 15902	
 15903	=The Growth of the Industrial Population.=--A revolution of such
 15904	magnitude in industry, transport, and finance, overturning as it did the
 15905	agrarian civilization of the old Northwest and reaching out to the very
 15906	borders of the country, could not fail to bring in its train
 15907	consequences of a striking character. Some were immediate and obvious.
 15908	Others require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their
 15909	complete significance. Outstanding among them was the growth of an
 15910	industrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,
 15911	and, to use Jefferson's phrase, dependent upon "the caprices and
 15912	casualties of trade" for a livelihood. This was a result, as the great
 15913	Virginian had foreseen, which flowed inevitably from public and private
 15914	efforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture.
 15915	
 15916	[Illustration: LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS, IN 1838, AN EARLY INDUSTRIAL
 15917	TOWN]
 15918	
 15919	It was estimated in 1860, on the basis of the census figures, that
 15920	mechanical production gave employment to 1,100,000 men and 285,000
 15921	women, making, if the average number of dependents upon them be
 15922	reckoned, nearly six million people or about one-sixth of the population
 15923	of the country sustained from manufactures. "This," runs the official
 15924	record, "was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many
 15925	of the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers; in the
 15926	distribution of their products, such as merchants, clerks, draymen,
 15927	mariners, the employees of railroads, expresses, and steamboats; of
 15928	capitalists, various artistic and professional classes, as well as
 15929	carpenters, bricklayers, painters, and the members of other mechanical
 15930	trades not classed as manufactures. It is safe to assume, then, that
 15931	one-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,
 15932	by manufacturing industry." Taking, however, the number of persons
 15933	directly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals
 15934	the astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from
 15935	the soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on Southern farms and
 15936	plantations.
 15937	
 15938	_Immigration._--The more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial
 15939	population is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an
 15940	immense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is
 15941	recalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in
 15942	securing immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping
 15943	being the fruits of their necessities. The answer to the enigma is to be
 15944	found partly in European conditions and partly in the cheapness of
 15945	transportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. Shrewd
 15946	observers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of
 15947	cheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. Some, among
 15948	them Chief Justice Ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white
 15949	labor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the
 15950	more costly of the two labor systems. The processes of nature were aided
 15951	by the policies of government in England and Germany.
 15952	
 15953	_The Coming of the Irish._--The opposition of the Irish people to the
 15954	English government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the
 15955	mid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main
 15956	support of the peasants. Catholic in religion, they had been compelled
 15957	to support a Protestant church. Tillers of the soil by necessity, they
 15958	were forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in England
 15959	whose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and
 15960	confiscation. Intensely loyal to their race, the Irish were subjected in
 15961	all things to the Parliament at London, in which their small minority of
 15962	representatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power
 15963	between the two contending English parties. To the constant political
 15964	irritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond
 15965	description. In cottages and fields and along the highways the victims
 15966	of starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity
 15967	afforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. Those who
 15968	were fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to America.
 15969	In 1844 the total immigration into the United States was less than
 15970	eighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than
 15971	three hundred thousand. Between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the
 15972	United Kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were
 15973	Irish. It has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the American
 15974	canals and railways of those days were built by the labor of Irishmen.
 15975	
 15976	_The German Migration._--To political discontent and economic distress,
 15977	such as was responsible for the coming of the Irish, may likewise be
 15978	traced the source of the Germanic migration. The potato blight that fell
 15979	upon Ireland visited the Rhine Valley and Southern Germany at the same
 15980	time with results as pitiful, if less extensive. The calamity inflicted
 15981	by nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic
 15982	conduct of German kings and princes. In 1848 there had occurred
 15983	throughout Europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and
 15984	democratic government. For a time it rode on a full tide of success.
 15985	Kings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional
 15986	government, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. Then came
 15987	reaction. Those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,
 15988	shot, or driven out of the land. Men of attainments and distinction,
 15989	whose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and
 15990	princes, sought an asylum in America, carrying with them to the land of
 15991	their adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. In 1847 over fifty
 15992	thousand Germans came to America, the forerunners of a migration that
 15993	increased, almost steadily, for many years. The record of 1860 showed
 15994	that in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found
 15995	homes in the United States. Far and wide they scattered, from the mills
 15996	and shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of Wisconsin
 15997	and Minnesota.
 15998	
 15999	_The Labor of Women and Children._--If the industries, canals, and
 16000	railways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still
 16001	important native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women
 16002	and children of the New England textile districts. Spinning and weaving,
 16003	by a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,
 16004	belonged to women. Indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,
 16005	and boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in
 16006	America, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. As
 16007	the wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated
 16008	by water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use Hamilton's
 16009	phrase, "the children of tender years," followed as a matter of course.
 16010	"The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in Lowell,"
 16011	wrote a French observer in 1836; "of this number nearly five thousand
 16012	are young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the
 16013	daughters of farmers from the different New England states." It was not
 16014	until after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be
 16015	the chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of
 16016	New England. It was then that the daughters of the Puritans, outdone by
 16017	the competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the
 16018	spinning jenny and the loom to other hands.
 16019	
 16020	=The Rise of Organized Labor.=--The changing conditions of American
 16021	life, marked by the spreading mill towns of New England, New York, and
 16022	Pennsylvania and the growth of cities like Buffalo, Cincinnati,
 16023	Louisville, St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago in the West, naturally
 16024	brought changes, as Jefferson had prophesied, in "manners and morals." A
 16025	few mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through
 16026	farming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of
 16027	thousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,
 16028	learning the power of cooperation and union.
 16029	
 16030	Even before the coming of steam and machinery, in the "good old days" of
 16031	handicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,
 16032	for example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement
 16033	of their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and
 16034	milder laws. The shoemakers of Philadelphia, organized in 1794,
 16035	conducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years
 16036	later for conspiracy. During the twenties and thirties, local labor
 16037	unions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost
 16038	immediately to city federations of the several crafts.
 16039	
 16040	As the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their
 16041	livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the
 16042	continent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft
 16043	organizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the
 16044	railways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,
 16045	including the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone
 16046	cutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general
 16047	history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding
 16048	scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt
 16049	was even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent
 16050	national organization; but it perished within three years through lack
 16051	of support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation
 16052	of Labor was to accomplish this task.
 16053	
 16054	All the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in
 16055	germ at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor
 16056	leaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor
 16057	political party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common
 16058	occurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,
 16059	1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger
 16060	field. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the
 16061	_Mechanics' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of
 16062	the New York _Workingman's Advocate_ shortly afterward. These
 16063	semi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade
 16064	papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular
 16065	crafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited
 16066	circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.
 16067	
 16068	=Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main
 16069	planks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,
 16070	manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still
 16071	prevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and
 16072	health of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal
 16073	of laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.
 16074	
 16075	Into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of
 16076	hostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited
 16077	little alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.
 16078	The Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,
 16079	invited "all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor
 16080	and none other." In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of
 16081	working people complained in 1830: "The poor have no laws; the laws are
 16082	made by the rich and of course for the rich." Here and there an
 16083	extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth
 16084	among all the people--the crudest kind of communism.
 16085	
 16086	Agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust
 16087	of both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and
 16088	banks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In
 16089	Philadelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates
 16090	were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were
 16091	victorious at the polls. "The balance of power has at length got into
 16092	the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,"
 16093	triumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in
 16094	1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor
 16095	ranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the
 16096	Democratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to
 16097	labor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced "trade union
 16098	politicians" as "demagogues," "levellers," and "rag, tag, and bobtail";
 16099	and some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood
 16100	suffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence
 16101	of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and
 16102	the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.
 16103	Labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and
 16104	practical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the
 16105	definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.
 16106	
 16107	
 16108	THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL POLITICS
 16109	
 16110	=Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of
 16111	Southern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together
 16112	in one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was
 16113	simple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials
 16114	and the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers
 16115	of Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its
 16116	tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy
 16117	produce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,
 16118	ran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were
 16119	one. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their
 16120	manufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and
 16121	grain. The union of the two sections under Jackson's management seemed
 16122	perfect.
 16123	
 16124	=The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to
 16125	the ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also
 16126	recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West
 16127	and drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.
 16128	The canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,
 16129	and the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the
 16130	middle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of
 16131	them, De Bow, lamenting that "the great cities of the North have
 16132	severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have
 16133	taken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce
 16134	produced on its borders." To this writer it was an astounding thing to
 16135	behold "the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi
 16136	River, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the
 16137	Illinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be
 16138	shipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept
 16139	the whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but
 16140	it is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same
 16141	channel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of
 16142	their former trade."
 16143	
 16144	If to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to
 16145	New Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea
 16146	than the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the
 16147	credit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and
 16148	produce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers
 16149	on the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted
 16150	with evident regret, in 1852, that "last autumn, the rich regions of
 16151	Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of
 16152	the Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be
 16153	shipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities
 16154	enable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce
 16155	until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer
 16156	obliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by
 16157	the way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their
 16158	shipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw
 16159	trade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is
 16160	constructing." Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly
 16161	forging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in
 16162	the West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism
 16163	to which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with
 16164	the passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down
 16165	as he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia
 16166	where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.
 16167	
 16168	=The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds
 16169	between the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in
 16170	manufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the
 16171	industries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like
 16172	that of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.
 16173	Moreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for
 16174	American factories, which called for protection against foreign
 16175	competition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or
 16176	no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer
 16177	protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for
 16178	industries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish
 16179	reciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on
 16180	wool for a high rate on textiles or iron.
 16181	
 16182	=The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing
 16183	together, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more
 16184	marked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw
 16185	materials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As
 16186	a result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to
 16187	turn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,
 16188	plows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe
 16189	in exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence
 16190	transshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of
 16191	distribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were
 16192	not carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern
 16193	masters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations
 16194	connected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in
 16195	exchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,
 16196	naturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern
 16197	planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed
 16198	heavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest
 16199	lower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.
 16200	
 16201	=The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern
 16202	dependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern
 16203	leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon
 16204	their enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a
 16205	tribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. "The South,"
 16206	expostulated De Bow, "stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast
 16207	population of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others
 16208	who, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her
 16209	trade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking
 16210	advantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after
 16211	turning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with
 16212	our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home."
 16213	
 16214	Southern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to
 16215	figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They
 16216	estimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full
 16217	value of their exports, a hundred millions or more, "to be used in the
 16218	manipulation of foreign imports." They calculated that no less than
 16219	forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They
 16220	reckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would
 16221	realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went
 16222	North. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent
 16223	some fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and
 16224	summer resorts of the North.
 16225	
 16226	=Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these
 16227	premises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire
 16228	program of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception
 16229	adverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,
 16230	injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor
 16231	afforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of
 16232	manufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the
 16233	tonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements
 16234	forging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national
 16235	banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a
 16236	safeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in
 16237	the South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly
 16238	compared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than
 16239	half a century before had sought to bind American interests.
 16240	
 16241	As oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,
 16242	so it can justify it again. "It is curious as it is melancholy and
 16243	distressing," came a broad hint from South Carolina, "to see how
 16244	striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the
 16245	manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which
 16246	formerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....
 16247	England said to her American colonies: 'You shall not trade with the
 16248	rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother
 16249	country.' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: 'You
 16250	shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we
 16251	produce.'" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control
 16252	the national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,
 16253	as America had done four score years before, its political and economic
 16254	independence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their
 16255	mighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose
 16256	into the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their
 16257	statesmen deepened into desperation.
 16258	
 16259	=Efforts to Start Southern Industries Fail.=--A few of them, seeing the
 16260	predominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce
 16261	manufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession
 16262	and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity
 16263	in the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of
 16264	mechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,
 16265	and indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were
 16266	meager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but
 16267	the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The
 16268	stream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The
 16269	Irish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had
 16270	before him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on
 16271	Western land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,
 16272	institution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where
 16273	it flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was
 16274	inevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with
 16275	equal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting
 16276	interest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to
 16277	grow in strength.
 16278	
 16279	=The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen
 16280	who frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was
 16281	its deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was
 16282	summed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South
 16283	Carolina: "Owing to the federative character of our government, the
 16284	great geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the
 16285	pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so
 16286	happened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly
 16287	opposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which
 16288	the Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing
 16289	to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those
 16290	states, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the
 16291	aid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general
 16292	government or by the state governments. The other of these interests
 16293	consists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which
 16294	can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be
 16295	advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come
 16296	in competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These
 16297	interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each
 16298	other. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern
 16299	manufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes
 16300	imposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the
 16301	interest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of
 16302	taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these
 16303	circumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing
 16304	taxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no
 16305	doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the
 16306	characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism." The economic
 16307	soundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for
 16308	the economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical
 16309	point is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the
 16310	progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting
 16311	statesmen.
 16312	
 16313	Their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on
 16314	what grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the
 16315	industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated
 16316	"aristocracy of wealth," bent upon the pursuit and attainment of
 16317	political power at Washington. "By the aid of various associated
 16318	interests," continued McDuffie, "the manufacturing capitalists have
 16319	obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of
 16320	Congress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon
 16321	selfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or
 16322	the bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than
 16323	the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.
 16324	Have we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff
 16325	men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...
 16326	The watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question
 16327	affecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and
 16328	such the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the
 16329	interests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided
 16330	and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states."
 16331	Thus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters
 16332	affecting national policies, was ruled by a "confederated interest"
 16333	which menaced the planting interest. As the former grew in magnitude and
 16334	attached to itself the free farmers of the West through channels of
 16335	trade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters
 16336	would be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.
 16337	Whether the theory was sound or not, Southern statesmen believed it and
 16338	acted upon it.

 16417	CHAPTER XIV
 16418	
 16419	THE PLANTING SYSTEM AND NATIONAL POLITICS
 16420	
 16421	
 16422	James Madison, the father of the federal Constitution, after he had
 16423	watched for many days the battle royal in the national convention of
 16424	1787, exclaimed that the contest was not between the large and the small
 16425	states, but between the commercial North and the planting South. From
 16426	the inauguration of Washington to the election of Lincoln the sectional
 16427	conflict, discerned by this penetrating thinker, exercised a profound
 16428	influence on the course of American politics. It was latent during the
 16429	"era of good feeling" when the Jeffersonian Republicans adopted
 16430	Federalist policies; it flamed up in the contest between the Democrats
 16431	and Whigs. Finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which
 16432	culminated in the Civil War.
 16433	
 16434	
 16435	SLAVERY--NORTH AND SOUTH
 16436	
 16437	=The Decline of Slavery in the North.=--At the time of the adoption of
 16438	the Constitution, slavery was lawful in all the Northern states except
 16439	Massachusetts. There were almost as many bondmen in New York as in
 16440	Georgia. New Jersey had more than Delaware or Tennessee, indeed nearly
 16441	as many as both combined. All told, however, there were only about forty
 16442	thousand in the North as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the
 16443	South. Moreover, most of the Northern slaves were domestic servants, not
 16444	laborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.
 16445	
 16446	There was, in the North, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the
 16447	system. Massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. In the same year,
 16448	Pennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. New Hampshire, where
 16449	there had been only a handful, Connecticut with a few thousand
 16450	domestics, and New Jersey early followed these examples. New York, in
 16451	1799, declared that all children born of slaves after July 4 of that
 16452	year should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827
 16453	it swept away the last vestiges of slavery. So with the passing of the
 16454	generation that had framed the Constitution, chattel servitude
 16455	disappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such
 16456	discriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on
 16457	colored voters.
 16458	
 16459	=The Growth of Northern Sentiment against Slavery.=--In both sections of
 16460	the country there early existed, among those more or less
 16461	philosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as
 16462	well as economic grounds. In the constitutional convention of 1787,
 16463	Gouverneur Morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the
 16464	whole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. About the same time
 16465	a society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency
 16466	of Benjamin Franklin, laid before Congress a petition that serious
 16467	attention be given to the emancipation of "those unhappy men who alone
 16468	in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage." When
 16469	Congress, acting on the recommendations of President Jefferson, provided
 16470	for the abolition of the foreign slave trade on January 1, 1808, several
 16471	Northern members joined with Southern members in condemning the system
 16472	as well as the trade. Later, colonization societies were formed to
 16473	encourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to Africa. James
 16474	Madison was president and Henry Clay vice president of such an
 16475	organization.
 16476	
 16477	The anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was
 16478	nevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.
 16479	
 16480	"We consider slavery your calamity, not your crime," wrote a
 16481	distinguished Boston clergyman to his Southern brethren, "and we will
 16482	share with you the burden of putting an end to it. We will consent that
 16483	the public lands shall be appropriated to this object.... I deprecate
 16484	everything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities."
 16485	
 16486	=Uncompromising Abolition.=--In a little while the spirit of generosity
 16487	was gone. Just as Jacksonian Democracy rose to power there appeared a
 16488	new kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition
 16489	agitator. For mild speculation on the evils of the system was
 16490	substituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant
 16491	emancipation. If a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831
 16492	may be taken when William Lloyd Garrison founded in Boston his
 16493	anti-slavery paper, _The Liberator_. With singleness of purpose and
 16494	utter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his
 16495	course of passionate denunciation. He apologized for having ever
 16496	"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition."
 16497	He chose for his motto: "Immediate and unconditional emancipation!" He
 16498	promised his readers that he would be "harsh as truth and uncompromising
 16499	as justice"; that he would not "think or speak or write with
 16500	moderation." Then he flung out his defiant call: "I am in earnest--I
 16501	will not equivocate--I will not excuse--I will not retreat a single
 16502	inch--and I will be heard....
 16503	
 16504	     'Such is the vow I take, so help me God.'"
 16505	
 16506	Though Garrison complained that "the apathy of the people is enough to
 16507	make every statue leap from its pedestal," he soon learned how alive the
 16508	masses were to the meaning of his propaganda. Abolition orators were
 16509	stoned in the street and hissed from the platform. Their meeting places
 16510	were often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. Garrison himself
 16511	was assaulted in the streets of Boston, finding refuge from the angry
 16512	mob behind prison bars. Lovejoy, a publisher in Alton, Illinois, for his
 16513	willingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his
 16514	printing press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who
 16515	disturbed the nation's peace of mind. The South, doubly frightened by a
 16516	slave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,
 16517	women, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.
 16518	"Now," exclaimed Calhoun, "it is a question which admits of neither
 16519	concession nor compromise."
 16520	
 16521	As the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force
 16522	and intensity. Whittier blew his blast from the New England hills:
 16523	
 16524	    "No slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;
 16525	     No fetters in the Bay State--no slave upon our land."
 16526	
 16527	Lowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of
 16528	his art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the South. Those
 16529	abolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions
 16530	against slavery and poured them in upon Congress. The flood of them was
 16531	so continuous that the House of Representatives, forgetting its
 16532	traditions, adopted in 1836 a "gag rule" which prevented the reading of
 16533	appeals and consigned them to the waste basket. Not until the Whigs were
 16534	in power nearly ten years later was John Quincy Adams able, after a
 16535	relentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.
 16536	
 16537	How deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for
 16538	immediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. If the
 16539	popular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its
 16540	extension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight
 16541	indeed. In 1844, the Free Soil candidate, Birney, polled 62,000 votes
 16542	out of over a million and a half; the Free Soil vote of the next
 16543	campaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to
 16544	the strength of the leader, Martin Van Buren; four years afterward it
 16545	receded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that
 16546	the pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the
 16547	people. Yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.
 16548	Young statesmen of the North, in whose hands the destiny of frightful
 16549	years was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their
 16550	consciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.
 16551	Charles Sumner afterward boasted that he read the _Liberator_ two years
 16552	before Wendell Phillips, the young Boston lawyer who cast aside his
 16553	profession to take up the dangerous cause.
 16554	
 16555	=Early Southern Opposition to Slavery.=--In the South, the sentiment
 16556	against slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also
 16557	come to an end there in due time. Washington disliked it and directed in
 16558	his will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his
 16559	wife. Jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which
 16560	he also lived, saying: "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure
 16561	when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of
 16562	the people that their liberties are the gift of God? Are they not to be
 16563	violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I
 16564	reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever." Nor
 16565	did Southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic
 16566	opinion. They accepted in 1787 the Ordinance which excluded slavery from
 16567	the Northwest territory forever and also the Missouri Compromise, which
 16568	shut it out of a vast section of the Louisiana territory.
 16569	
 16570	=The Revolution in the Slave System.=--Among the representatives of
 16571	South Carolina and Georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of
 16572	Washington and Jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of
 16573	Southern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,
 16574	rather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. The invention
 16575	of the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton
 16576	which the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly
 16577	supply. Almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as
 16578	the small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the
 16579	uplands or to the Northwest.
 16580	
 16581	The demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.
 16582	The number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in Washington's day to more than
 16583	three millions in 1850. At the same time slavery itself was transformed.
 16584	Instead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same
 16585	families of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation
 16586	system of the Far South and Southwest where masters were ever moving and
 16587	ever extending their holdings of lands and slaves. This in turn reacted
 16588	on the older South where the raising of slaves for the market became a
 16589	regular and highly profitable business.

 16593	JOHN C. CALHOUN]
 16594	
 16595	=Slavery Defended as a Positive Good.=--As the abolition agitation
 16596	increased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became
 16597	fainter and fainter in the South. Then apologies were superseded by
 16598	claims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. Calhoun,
 16599	in a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, sounded the new note by
 16600	declaring slavery "instead of an evil, a good--a positive good." His
 16601	reasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the
 16602	community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the
 16603	arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his
 16604	master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than
 16605	the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts
 16606	between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this
 16607	respect, he concluded, "will become more and more manifest, if left
 16608	undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in
 16609	wealth and numbers."
 16610	
 16611	=Slave Owners Dominate Politics.=--The new doctrine of Calhoun was
 16612	eagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow
 16613	the small farmers of the South and as they beheld the menace of
 16614	abolition growing upon the horizon. It formed, as they viewed matters, a
 16615	moral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. It
 16616	warranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution
 16617	so necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.
 16618	
 16619	Though in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty
 16620	thousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they
 16621	had an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. They were knit
 16622	together by the bonds of a common interest. They had leisure and wealth.
 16623	They could travel and attend conferences and conventions. Throughout the
 16624	South and largely in the North, they had the press, the schools, and the
 16625	pulpits on their side. They formed, as it were, a mighty union for the
 16626	protection and advancement of their common cause. Aided by those
 16627	mechanics and farmers of the North who stuck by Jacksonian Democracy
 16628	through thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal
 16629	government. "We nominate Presidents," exultantly boasted a Richmond
 16630	newspaper; "the North elects them."
 16631	
 16632	This jubilant Southern claim was conceded by William H. Seward, a
 16633	Republican Senator from New York, in a speech describing the power of
 16634	slavery in the national government. "A party," he said, "is in one sense
 16635	a joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the
 16636	action and management of the concern.... The slaveholders, contributing
 16637	in an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the Democratic party,
 16638	necessarily dictate and prescribe its policy." He went on: "The
 16639	slaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the
 16640	slaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two
 16641	members of the Senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three
 16642	members of the House of Representatives, and one hundred and five of the
 16643	two hundred and ninety-five electors of President and Vice-President of
 16644	the United States." Then he considered the slave power in the Supreme
 16645	Court. "That tribunal," he exclaimed, "consists of a chief justice and
 16646	eight associate justices. Of these, five were called from slave states
 16647	and four from free states. The opinions and bias of each of them were
 16648	carefully considered by the President and Senate when he was appointed.
 16649	Not one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to
 16650	the slaveholder's exposition of the Constitution." Such was the Northern
 16651	view of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,
 16652	challenged the whole country in 1860.
 16653	
 16654	[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES]
 16655	
 16656	
 16657	SLAVERY IN NATIONAL POLITICS
 16658	
 16659	=National Aspects of Slavery.=--It may be asked why it was that slavery,
 16660	founded originally on state law and subject to state government, was
 16661	drawn into the current of national affairs. The answer is simple. There
 16662	were, in the first place, constitutional reasons. The Congress of the
 16663	United States had to make all needful rules for the government of the
 16664	territories, the District of Columbia, the forts and other property
 16665	under national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether
 16666	slavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. Upon
 16667	Congress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever
 16668	a territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether
 16669	slavery should be sanctioned or excluded. Under the Constitution,
 16670	provision was made for the return of runaway slaves; Congress had the
 16671	power to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. Since the
 16672	control of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had
 16673	to face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature
 16674	through the mails. Finally citizens had the right of petition; it
 16675	inheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the
 16676	first amendment to the Constitution. It was therefore legal for
 16677	abolitionists to present to Congress their petitions, even if they asked
 16678	for something which it had no right to grant. It was thus impossible,
 16679	constitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine
 16680	the discussion of it to state politics.
 16681	
 16682	There were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was
 16683	inevitably drawn into the national sphere. It was the basis of the
 16684	planting system which had direct commercial relations with the North and
 16685	European countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,
 16686	bounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. The planters of
 16687	the South, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff
 16688	as a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of Northern industries. As
 16689	heavy borrowers of money in the North, they were generally in favor of
 16690	"easy money," if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their
 16691	debts. This threw most of them into opposition to the Whig program for a
 16692	United States Bank. All financial aids to American shipping they stoutly
 16693	resisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by
 16694	English shippers. Internal improvements, those substantial ties that
 16695	were binding the West to the East and turning the traffic from New
 16696	Orleans to Philadelphia and New York, they viewed with alarm. Free
 16697	homesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the South
 16698	by building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their
 16699	interests. Thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist
 16700	or turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its
 16701	defenders into the political conflict that centered at Washington.
 16702	
 16703	=Slavery and the Territories--the Missouri Compromise (1820).=--Though
 16704	men continually talked about "taking slavery out of politics," it could
 16705	not be done. By 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the
 16706	anti-slavery sentiment so strong, that Missouri's quest for admission
 16707	brought both houses of Congress into a deadlock that was broken only by
 16708	compromise. The South, having half the Senators, could prevent the
 16709	admission of Missouri stripped of slavery; and the North, powerful in
 16710	the House of Representatives, could keep Missouri with slavery out of
 16711	the union indefinitely. An adjustment of pretensions was the last
 16712	resort. Maine, separated from the parent state of Massachusetts, was
 16713	brought into the union with freedom and Missouri with bondage. At the
 16714	same time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast Louisiana
 16715	territory north of the parallel of 36 o 30' should be, like the old
 16716	Northwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.
 16717	In reality this was an immense gain for liberty. The area dedicated to
 16718	free farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. The
 16719	principle was once more asserted that Congress had full power to prevent
 16720	slavery in the territories.
 16721	
 16722	[Illustration: THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE]
 16723	
 16724	=The Territorial Question Reopened by the Wilmot Proviso.=--To the
 16725	Southern leaders, the annexation of Texas and the conquest of Mexico
 16726	meant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing
 16727	wealth and population of the North. Texas, it was said, could be divided
 16728	into four slave states. The new territories secured by the treaty of
 16729	peace with Mexico contained the promise of at least three more. Thus, as
 16730	each new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the
 16731	South could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. No
 16732	wonder Southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of Texas and the
 16733	conquest of Mexico, slavery and King Cotton triumphant--secure for all
 16734	time against adverse legislation. Northern leaders were equally
 16735	convinced that the Southern prophecy was true. Abolitionists and
 16736	moderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. Texas, they
 16737	lamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. "No living
 16738	man," cried one, "will see the end of slavery in the United States!"
 16739	
 16740	It so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would
 16741	secure slavery let loose a storm against it. A sign appeared first on
 16742	August 6, 1846, only a few months after war was declared on Mexico. On
 16743	that day, David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, introduced into
 16744	the House of Representatives a resolution to the effect that, as an
 16745	express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory
 16746	from the republic of Mexico, slavery should be forever excluded from
 16747	every part of it. "The Wilmot Proviso," as the resolution was popularly
 16748	called, though defeated on that occasion, was a challenge to the South.
 16749	
 16750	The South answered the challenge. Speaking in the House of
 16751	Representatives, Robert Toombs of Georgia boldly declared: "In the
 16752	presence of the living God, if by your legislation you seek to drive us
 16753	from the territories of California and New Mexico ... I am for
 16754	disunion." South Carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and
 16755	the time had come to join her sister states "in resisting the
 16756	application of the Wilmot Proviso at any and all hazards." A conference,
 16757	assembled at Jackson, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1849, called a
 16758	general convention of Southern states to meet at Nashville the following
 16759	summer. The avowed purpose was to arrest "the course of aggression" and,
 16760	if that was not possible, to provide "in the last resort for their
 16761	separate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will
 16762	afford protection to their liberties and rights." States that had
 16763	spurned South Carolina's plea for nullification in 1832 responded to
 16764	this new appeal with alacrity--an augury of the secession to come.
 16765

 16768	HENRY CLAY]
 16769	
 16770	=The Great Debate of 1850.=--The temper of the country was white hot
 16771	when Congress convened in December, 1849. It was a memorable session,
 16772	memorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable
 16773	for the grand Compromise of 1850 which it produced. In the Senate sat
 16774	for the last time three heroic figures: Webster from the North, Calhoun
 16775	from the South, and Clay from a border state. For nearly forty years
 16776	these three had been leaders of men. All had grown old and gray in
 16777	service. Calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to
 16778	be borne from the political arena forever. Clay and Webster had but two
 16779	more years in their allotted span.
 16780	
 16781	Experience, learning, statecraft--all these things they now marshaled in
 16782	a mighty effort to solve the slavery problem. On January 29, 1850, Clay
 16783	offered to the Senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides;
 16784	and a few days later, in a powerful oration, he made a passionate appeal
 16785	for a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices. Calhoun relentlessly
 16786	demanded the full measure of justice for the South: equal rights in the
 16787	territories bought by common blood; the return of runaway slaves as
 16788	required by the Constitution; the suppression of the abolitionists; and
 16789	the restoration of the balance of power between the North and the South.
 16790	Webster, in his notable "Seventh of March speech," condemned the Wilmot
 16791	Proviso, advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law,
 16792	denounced the abolitionists, and made a final plea for the Constitution,
 16793	union, and liberty. This was the address which called forth from
 16794	Whittier the poem, "Ichabod," deploring the fall of the mighty one whom
 16795	he thought lost to all sense of faith and honor.
 16796	
 16797	=The Terms of the Compromise of 1850.=--When the debates were closed,
 16798	the results were totaled in a series of compromise measures, all of
 16799	which were signed in September, 1850, by the new President, Millard
 16800	Fillmore, who had taken office two months before on the death of Zachary
 16801	Taylor. By these acts the boundaries of Texas were adjusted and the
 16802	territory of New Mexico created, subject to the provision that all or
 16803	any part of it might be admitted to the union "with or without slavery
 16804	as their constitution may provide at the time of their admission." The
 16805	Territory of Utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to
 16806	slavery, thus repudiating the Wilmot Proviso without guaranteeing
 16807	slavery to the planters. California was admitted as a free state under a
 16808	constitution in which the people of the territory had themselves
 16809	prohibited slavery.
 16810	
 16811	The slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia, but slavery
 16812	itself existed as before at the capital of the nation. This concession
 16813	to anti-slavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law,
 16814	drastic in spirit and in letter. It placed the enforcement of its terms
 16815	in the hands of federal officers appointed from Washington and so
 16816	removed it from the control of authorities locally elected. It provided
 16817	that masters or their agents, on filing claims in due form, might
 16818	summarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their "alleged
 16819	fugitives" the right of trial by jury, the right to witness, the right
 16820	to offer any testimony in evidence. Finally, to "put teeth" into the
 16821	act, heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted
 16822	in obstructing the enforcement of the law. Such was the Great Compromise
 16823	of 1850.
 16824	
 16825	[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON REPRESENTING WEBSTER "STEALING CLAY'S
 16826	THUNDER"]
 16827	
 16828	=The Pro-slavery Triumph in the Election of 1852.=--The results of the
 16829	election of 1852 seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary
 16830	of slavery agitation and wanted peace. Both parties, Whigs and
 16831	Democrats, endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the Great
 16832	Compromise. The Democrats, with Franklin Pierce as their leader, swept
 16833	the country against the war hero, General Winfield Scott, on whom the
 16834	Whigs had staked their hopes. Even Webster, broken with grief at his
 16835	failure to receive the nomination, advised his friends to vote for
 16836	Pierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death.
 16837	The verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time
 16838	everybody, save a handful of disgruntled agitators, looked upon Clay's
 16839	settlement as the last word. "The people, especially the business men of
 16840	the country," says Elson, "were utterly weary of the agitation and they
 16841	gave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest." The Free
 16842	Soil party, condemning slavery as "a sin against God and a crime against
 16843	man," and advocating freedom for the territories, failed to carry a
 16844	single state. In fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years
 16845	earlier--156,000 as against nearly 3,000,000, the combined vote of the
 16846	Whigs and Democrats. It is not surprising, therefore, that President
 16847	Pierce, surrounded in his cabinet by strong Southern sympathizers, could
 16848	promise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition
 16849	movement in the bud.
 16850	
 16851	=Anti-slavery Agitation Continued.=--The promise was more difficult to
 16852	fulfill than to utter. In fact, the vigorous execution of one measure
 16853	included in the Compromise--the fugitive slave law--only made matters
 16854	worse. Designed as security for the planters, it proved a powerful
 16855	instrument in their undoing. Slavery five hundred miles away on a
 16856	Louisiana plantation was so remote from the North that only the
 16857	strongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it. "Slave
 16858	catching," "man hunting" by federal officers on the streets of
 16859	Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, or Milwaukee and in the hamlets
 16860	and villages of the wide-stretching farm lands of the North was another
 16861	matter. It brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands
 16862	of men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the
 16863	system. Law-abiding business men, mechanics, farmers, and women, when
 16864	they saw peaceful negroes, who had resided in their neighborhoods
 16865	perhaps for years, torn away by federal officers and carried back to
 16866	bondage, were transformed into enemies of the law. They helped slaves to
 16867	escape; they snatched them away from officers who had captured them;
 16868	they broke open jails and carried fugitives off to Canada.
 16869	
 16870	Assistance to runaway slaves, always more or less common in the North,
 16871	was by this time organized into a system. Regular routes, known as
 16872	"underground railways," were laid out across the free states into
 16873	Canada, and trusted friends of freedom maintained "underground stations"
 16874	where fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night
 16875	journeys. Funds were raised and secret agents sent into the South to
 16876	help negroes to flee. One negro woman, Harriet Tubman, "the Moses of her
 16877	people," with headquarters at Philadelphia, is accredited with nineteen
 16878	invasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred
 16879	negroes. Those who worked at this business were in constant peril. One
 16880	underground operator, Calvin Fairbank, spent nearly twenty years in
 16881	prison for aiding fugitives from justice. Yet perils and prisons did not
 16882	stay those determined men and women who, in obedience to their
 16883	consciences, set themselves to this lawless work.
 16884	
 16885	[Illustration: HARRIET BEECHER STOWE]
 16886	
 16887	From thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came
 16888	some of the scenes and themes of the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe,
 16889	"Uncle Tom's Cabin," published two years after the Compromise of 1850.
 16890	Her stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word
 16891	pictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers.
 16892	Though the book was unfair to the South and was denounced as a hideous
 16893	distortion of the truth, it was quickly dramatized and played in every
 16894	city and town throughout the North. Topsy, Little Eva, Uncle Tom, the
 16895	fleeing slave, Eliza Harris, and the cruel slave driver, Simon Legree,
 16896	with his baying blood hounds, became living specters in many a home that
 16897	sought to bar the door to the "unpleasant and irritating business of
 16898	slavery agitation."
 16899	
 16900	
 16901	THE DRIFT OF EVENTS TOWARD THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT
 16902	
 16903	=Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.=--To practical men, after all, the
 16904	"rub-a-dub" agitation of a few abolitionists, an occasional riot over
 16905	fugitive slaves, and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or
 16906	transient importance. They could point with satisfaction to the election
 16907	returns of 1852; but their very security was founded upon shifting
 16908	sands. The magnificent triumph of the pro-slavery Democrats in 1852
 16909	brought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their
 16910	feet. Emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their
 16911	opponents, they now dared to repeal the Missouri Compromise. The leader
 16912	in this fateful enterprise was Stephen A. Douglas, Senator from
 16913	Illinois, and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the
 16914	organization of territorial government in the regions west of Iowa and
 16915	Missouri.
 16916	
 16917	Douglas, like Clay and Webster before him, was consumed by a strong
 16918	passion for the presidency, and, to reach his goal, it was necessary to
 16919	win the support of the South. This he undoubtedly sought to do when he
 16920	introduced on January 4, 1854, a bill organizing the Nebraska territory
 16921	on the principle of the Compromise of 1850; namely, that the people in
 16922	the territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or
 16923	not. Unwittingly the avalanche was started.
 16924	
 16925	After a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on
 16926	Douglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill became a law on May 30, 1854. The
 16927	measure created two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and provided that
 16928	they, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as
 16929	states "with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at
 16930	the time of their admission." Not content with this, the law went on to
 16931	declare the Missouri Compromise null and void as being inconsistent with
 16932	the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states
 16933	and territories. Thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,
 16934	dedicated to freedom by solemn agreement, was thrown open to slavery. A
 16935	desperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was
 16936	the outcome in Kansas.
 16937	
 16938	If Douglas fancied that the North would receive the overthrow of the
 16939	Missouri Compromise in the same temper that it greeted Clay's
 16940	settlement, he was rapidly disillusioned. A blast of rage, terrific in
 16941	its fury, swept from Maine to Iowa. Staid old Boston hanged him in
 16942	effigy with an inscription--"Stephen A. Douglas, author of the infamous
 16943	Nebraska bill: the Benedict Arnold of 1854." City after city burned him
 16944	in effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the Atlantic
 16945	coast to Chicago in the light of the fires. Thousands of Whigs and
 16946	Free-soil Democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at
 16947	least tolerated the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, declaring that the startling
 16948	measure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule
 16949	the whole country. A gage of defiance was thrown down to the
 16950	abolitionists. An issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had
 16951	been unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the Far South. That issue
 16952	was whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or
 16953	be allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free
 16954	states in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to
 16955	the slave power.
 16956	
 16957	=The Rise of the Republican Party.=--Events of terrible significance,
 16958	swiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight
 16959	into civil war. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill rent the old parties asunder
 16960	and called into being the Republican party. While that bill was pending
 16961	in Congress, many Northern Whigs and Democrats had come to the
 16962	conclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must
 16963	follow the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Several places claim to be
 16964	the original home of the Republican party; but historians generally
 16965	yield it to Wisconsin. At Ripon in that state, a mass meeting of Whigs
 16966	and Democrats assembled in February, 1854, and resolved to form a new
 16967	party if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass. At a second meeting a
 16968	fusion committee representing Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats was
 16969	formed and the name Republican--the name of Jefferson's old party--was
 16970	selected. All over the country similar meetings were held and political
 16971	committees were organized.
 16972	
 16973	When the presidential campaign of 1856 began the Republicans entered the
 16974	contest. After a preliminary conference in Pittsburgh in February, they
 16975	held a convention in Philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform
 16976	opposing the extension of slavery to the territories. John C. Fremont,
 16977	the distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. The results
 16978	of the election were astounding as compared with the Free-soil failure
 16979	of the preceding election. Prominent men like Longfellow, Washington
 16980	Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George William
 16981	Curtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for
 16982	"free labor, free speech, free men, free Kansas, and Fremont."
 16983	Nevertheless the victory of the Democrats was decisive. Their candidate,
 16984	James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114
 16985	electoral votes.
 16986	
 16987	[Illustration: SLAVE AND FREE SOIL ON EVE OF CIVIL WAR]
 16988	
 16989	=The Dred Scott Decision (1857).=--In his inaugural, Buchanan vaguely
 16990	hinted that in a forthcoming decision the Supreme Court would settle one
 16991	of the vital questions of the day. This was a reference to the Dred
 16992	Scott case then pending. Scott was a slave who had been taken by his
 16993	master into the upper Louisiana territory, where freedom had been
 16994	established by the Missouri Compromise, and then carried back into his
 16995	old state of Missouri. He brought suit for his liberty on the ground
 16996	that his residence in the free territory made him free. This raised the
 16997	question whether the law of Congress prohibiting slavery north of 36 o
 16998	30' was authorized by the federal Constitution or not. The Court might
 16999	have avoided answering it by saying that even though Scott was free in
 17000	the territory, he became a slave again in Missouri by virtue of the law
 17001	of that state. The Court, however, faced the issue squarely. It held
 17002	that Scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the Missouri
 17003	Compromise violated the Constitution and was null and void.
 17004	
 17005	The decision was a triumph for the South. It meant that Congress after
 17006	all had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Under the decree
 17007	of the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an
 17008	amendment to the Constitution which required a two-thirds vote in
 17009	Congress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. Such an
 17010	amendment was obviously impossible--the Southern states were too
 17011	numerous; but the Republicans were not daunted. "We know," said Lincoln,
 17012	"the Court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we
 17013	shall do what we can to have it overrule this." Legislatures of Northern
 17014	states passed resolutions condemning the decision and the Republican
 17015	platform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the Constitution carried
 17016	slavery into the territories as "a dangerous political heresy at
 17017	variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with
 17018	legislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and
 17019	subversive of the peace and harmony of the country."
 17020	
 17021	=The Panic of 1857.=--In the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the
 17022	Dred Scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever
 17023	afflicted the country. In the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen
 17024	railroad corporations, including the Erie, Michigan Central, and the
 17025	Illinois Central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance
 17026	companies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the
 17027	North, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the
 17028	markets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working
 17029	people were thrown out of employment; "hunger meetings" of idle men were
 17030	held in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, "We want
 17031	bread," were flung out. In New York, working men threatened to invade
 17032	the Council Chamber to demand "work or bread," and the frightened mayor
 17033	called for the police and soldiers. For this distressing state of
 17034	affairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence
 17035	than the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of
 17036	March, 1857, a Democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates
 17037	of duty. In the manufacturing districts of the North, the panic was
 17038	ascribed to the "Democratic assault on business." So an old issue was
 17039	again vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential
 17040	campaign.
 17041	
 17042	=The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.=--The following year the interest of the
 17043	whole country was drawn to a series of debates held in Illinois by
 17044	Lincoln and Douglas, both candidates for the United States Senate. In
 17045	the course of his campaign Lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that
 17046	"a house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government
 17047	cannot endure permanently half slave and half free." At the same time he
 17048	had accused Douglas, Buchanan, and the Supreme Court of acting in
 17049	concert to make slavery national. This daring statement arrested the
 17050	attention of Douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of
 17051	"squatter sovereignty;" that is, the right of the people of each
 17052	territory "to vote slavery up or down." After a few long-distance shots
 17053	at each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss
 17054	the issues of the day. Never had such crowds been seen at political
 17055	meetings in Illinois. Farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,
 17056	and housewives their baking to hear "Honest Abe" and "the Little Giant."
 17057	
 17058	The results of the series of debates were momentous. Lincoln clearly
 17059	defined his position. The South, he admitted, was entitled under the
 17060	Constitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. He hoped that there might be
 17061	no new slave states; but he did not see how Congress could exclude the
 17062	people of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt
 17063	a constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. He favored the
 17064	gradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and the total
 17065	exclusion of it from the territories of the United States by act of
 17066	Congress.
 17067	
 17068	Moreover, he drove Douglas into a hole by asking how he squared
 17069	"squatter sovereignty" with the Dred Scott decision; how, in other
 17070	words, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the Court
 17071	had declared that Congress, the superior power, could not do it under
 17072	the Constitution? To this baffling question Douglas lamely replied that
 17073	the inhabitants of a territory, by "unfriendly legislation," might make
 17074	property in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. This
 17075	answer to Lincoln's query alienated many Southern Democrats who believed
 17076	that the Dred Scott decision settled the question of slavery in the
 17077	territories for all time. Douglas won the election to the Senate; but
 17078	Lincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the
 17079	campaign for President two years later.
 17080	
 17081	=John Brown's Raid.=--To the abolitionists the line of argument pursued
 17082	by Lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the
 17083	states where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. One of them, a grim
 17084	and resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned
 17085	from agitation to violence. "These men are all talk; what is needed is
 17086	action--action!" So spoke John Brown of New York. During the sanguinary
 17087	struggle in Kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,
 17088	to help drive slave owners from the free soil of the West. There he
 17089	committed deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a
 17090	price put upon his head. Still he kept on the path of "action." Aided by
 17091	funds from Northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers
 17092	around him, saying to them: "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
 17093	He went into Virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,
 17094	"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of
 17095	Samson." He seized the government armory at Harper's Ferry, declared
 17096	free the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in
 17097	defense of their liberty. His was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.
 17098	Armed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.
 17099	Tried for treason, Brown was condemned to death. The governor of
 17100	Virginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground
 17101	that the prisoner was simply a lunatic. "This is a beautiful country,"
 17102	said the stern old Brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way
 17103	to the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long
 17104	journey. "So perish all such enemies of Virginia. All such enemies of
 17105	the Union. All such foes of the human race," solemnly announced the
 17106	executioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.
 17107	
 17108	The raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. Abolitionists
 17109	looked upon Brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his
 17110	execution. Longfellow wrote in his diary: "This will be a great day in
 17111	our history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old
 17112	one." Jefferson Davis saw in the affair "the invasion of a state by a
 17113	murderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder
 17114	helpless women and children"--a crime for which the leader had met a
 17115	felon's death. Lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an
 17116	enthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he
 17117	fancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt
 17118	which ended in "little else than his own execution." To Republican
 17119	leaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. They were taunted
 17120	by the Democrats with responsibility for the deed. Douglas declared his
 17121	"firm and deliberate conviction that the Harper's Ferry crime was the
 17122	natural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of
 17123	the Republican party." So persistent were such attacks that the
 17124	Republicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce Brown's raid "as among
 17125	the gravest of crimes."
 17126	
 17127	=The Democrats Divided.=--When the Democratic convention met at
 17128	Charleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after Brown's execution,
 17129	it soon became clear that there was danger ahead. Between the extreme
 17130	slavery advocates of the Far South and the so-called pro-slavery
 17131	Democrats of the Douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to
 17132	party loyalty could bridge. As the spokesman of the West, Douglas knew
 17133	that, while the North was not abolitionist, it was passionately set
 17134	against an extension of slavery into the territories by act of Congress;
 17135	that squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable
 17136	to the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.
 17137	Southern leaders would not accept his opinion. Yancey, speaking for
 17138	Alabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition
 17139	that slavery was in itself right. He taunted the Northern Democrats with
 17140	taking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do
 17141	anything about it. That, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all
 17142	discord, the source of "Black Republicanism," as well as squatter
 17143	sovereignty. The gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the
 17144	Northern delegates: "You must not apologize for slavery; you must
 17145	declare it right; you must advocate its extension." The challenge, so
 17146	bluntly put, was as bluntly answered. "Gentlemen of the South,"
 17147	responded a delegate from Ohio, "you mistake us. You mistake us. We will
 17148	not do it."
 17149	
 17150	For ten days the Charleston convention wrangled over the platform and
 17151	balloted for the nomination of a candidate. Douglas, though in the lead,
 17152	could not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. For more than
 17153	fifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.
 17154	Then in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at
 17155	Baltimore. When the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as
 17156	high as ever. The division into two irreconcilable factions was
 17157	unchanged. Uncompromising delegates from the South withdrew to Richmond,
 17158	nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President, and put forth
 17159	a platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and
 17160	the duty of the federal government to protect them. The delegates who
 17161	remained at Baltimore nominated Douglas and endorsed his doctrine of
 17162	squatter sovereignty.
 17163	
 17164	=The Constitutional Union Party.=--While the Democratic party was being
 17165	disrupted, a fragment of the former Whig party, known as the
 17166	Constitutional Unionists, held a convention at Baltimore and selected
 17167	national candidates: John Bell from Tennessee and Edward Everett from
 17168	Massachusetts. A melancholy interest attached to this assembly. It was
 17169	mainly composed of old men whose political views were those of Clay and
 17170	Webster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. In their platform they
 17171	sought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their
 17172	fellow citizens to "support the Constitution of the country, the union
 17173	of the states, and the enforcement of the laws." The party that
 17174	campaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the Democrats
 17175	and derision from the Republicans and polled less than one-fourth the
 17176	votes.
 17177	
 17178	=The Republican Convention.=--With the Whigs definitely forced into a
 17179	separate group, the Republican convention at Chicago was fated to be
 17180	sectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.
 17181	As the Democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four
 17182	years before was on the high road to success at last. New and powerful
 17183	recruits were found. The advocates of a high protective tariff and the
 17184	friends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with
 17185	enthusiastic foes of slavery. While still firm in their opposition to
 17186	slavery in the territories, the Republicans went on record in favor of a
 17187	homestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs
 17188	duties designed "to encourage the development of the industrial
 17189	interests of the whole country." The platform was greeted with cheers
 17190	which, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became
 17191	loud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were
 17192	read.
 17193	
 17194	Having skillfully drawn a platform to unite the North in opposition to
 17195	slavery and the planting system, the Republicans were also adroit in
 17196	their selection of a candidate. The tariff plank might carry
 17197	Pennsylvania, a Democratic state; but Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were
 17198	equally essential to success at the polls. The southern counties of
 17199	these states were filled with settlers from Virginia, North Carolina,
 17200	and Kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends
 17201	of abolition. Moreover, remembering the old fight on the United States
 17202	Bank in Andrew Jackson's day, they were suspicious of men from the East.
 17203	Accordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of Seward, the leading
 17204	Republican statesman and "favorite son" of New York.
 17205	
 17206	After much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion
 17207	that Abraham Lincoln of Illinois was the most "available" candidate. He
 17208	was of Southern origin, born in Kentucky in 1809, a fact that told
 17209	heavily in the campaign in the Ohio Valley. He was a man of the soil,
 17210	the son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored
 17211	in the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as "honest Abe, the
 17212	rail-splitter." It was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no
 17213	abolitionist. He had come dangerously near to Seward's radicalism in his
 17214	"house-divided-against-itself" speech but he had never committed himself
 17215	to the reckless doctrine that there was a "higher law" than the
 17216	Constitution. Slavery in the South he tolerated as a bitter fact;
 17217	slavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. Of his
 17218	sincerity there could be no doubt. He was a speaker and writer of
 17219	singular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,
 17220	the hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed
 17221	words. He had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too
 17222	far. He was the man of the hour! Amid lusty cheers from ten thousand
 17223	throats, Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republicans. In
 17224	the ensuing election, he carried all the free states except New Jersey.

 17312	CHAPTER XV
 17313	
 17314	THE CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION
 17315	
 17316	
 17317	"The irrepressible conflict is about to be visited upon us through the
 17318	Black Republican nominee and his fanatical, diabolical Republican
 17319	party," ran an appeal to the voters of South Carolina during the
 17320	campaign of 1860. If that calamity comes to pass, responded the governor
 17321	of the state, the answer should be a declaration of independence. In a
 17322	few days the suspense was over. The news of Lincoln's election came
 17323	speeding along the wires. Prepared for the event, the editor of the
 17324	Charleston _Mercury_ unfurled the flag of his state amid wild cheers
 17325	from an excited throng in the streets. Then he seized his pen and wrote:
 17326	"The tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been
 17327	initiated." The issue was submitted to the voters in the choice of
 17328	delegates to a state convention called to cast off the yoke of the
 17329	Constitution.
 17330	
 17331	
 17332	THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY
 17333	
 17334	=Secession.=--As arranged, the convention of South Carolina assembled in
 17335	December and without a dissenting voice passed the ordinance of
 17336	secession withdrawing from the union. Bells were rung exultantly, the
 17337	roar of cannon carried the news to outlying counties, fireworks lighted
 17338	up the heavens, and champagne flowed. The crisis so long expected had
 17339	come at last; even the conservatives who had prayed that they might
 17340	escape the dreadful crash greeted it with a sigh of relief.
 17341	
 17342	[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1861
 17343	
 17344	The border states (in purple) remained loyal.]
 17345	
 17346	South Carolina now sent forth an appeal to her sister states--states
 17347	that had in Jackson's day repudiated nullification as leading to "the
 17348	dissolution of the union." The answer that came this time was in a
 17349	different vein. A month had hardly elapsed before five other
 17350	states--Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana--had
 17351	withdrawn from the union. In February, Texas followed. Virginia,
 17352	hesitating until the bombardment of Fort Sumter forced a conclusion,
 17353	seceded in April; but fifty-five of the one hundred and forty-three
 17354	delegates dissented, foreshadowing the creation of the new state of West
 17355	Virginia which Congress admitted to the union in 1863. In May, North
 17356	Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee announced their independence.
 17357	
 17358	=Secession and the Theories of the Union.=--In severing their relations
 17359	with the union, the seceding states denied every point in the Northern
 17360	theory of the Constitution. That theory, as every one knows, was
 17361	carefully formulated by Webster and elaborated by Lincoln. According to
 17362	it, the union was older than the states; it was created before the
 17363	Declaration of Independence for the purpose of common defense. The
 17364	Articles of Confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the
 17365	Constitution sealed it forever. The federal government was not a
 17366	creature of state governments. It was erected by the people and derived
 17367	its powers directly from them. "It is," said Webster, "the people's
 17368	Constitution, the people's government; made for the people; made by the
 17369	people; and answerable to the people. The people of the United States
 17370	have declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law." When a
 17371	state questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it
 17372	cannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the
 17373	decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The union of these
 17374	states is perpetual, ran Lincoln's simple argument in the first
 17375	inaugural; the federal Constitution has no provision for its own
 17376	termination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in
 17377	the instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the
 17378	consent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state
 17379	can lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the
 17380	United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary. This was the system
 17381	which he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office
 17382	"registered in heaven."
 17383	
 17384	All this reasoning Southern statesmen utterly rejected. In their opinion
 17385	the thirteen original states won their independence as separate and
 17386	sovereign powers. The treaty of peace with Great Britain named them all
 17387	and acknowledged them "to be free, sovereign, and independent states."
 17388	The Articles of Confederation very explicitly declared that "each state
 17389	retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence." The Constitution
 17390	was a "league of nations" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate
 17391	powers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into
 17392	effect. They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and
 17393	voluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of
 17394	Hayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis. In seceding, the Southern states
 17395	had only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct
 17396	in every particular. So conventions were summoned, elections were held,
 17397	and "sovereign assemblies of the people" set aside the Constitution in
 17398	the same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.
 17399	Thus, said the Southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the
 17400	letter of the law carried into effect.
 17401	
 17402	[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS]
 17403	
 17404	=The Formation of the Confederacy.=--Acting on the call of Mississippi,
 17405	a congress of delegates from the seceded states met at Montgomery,
 17406	Alabama, and on February 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union. It
 17407	selected, as provisional president, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, a
 17408	man well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership, a graduate
 17409	of West Point, who had rendered distinguished service on the field of
 17410	battle in the Mexican War, in public office, and as a member of
 17411	Congress.
 17412	
 17413	In March, a permanent constitution of the Confederate states was
 17414	drafted. It was quickly ratified by the states; elections were held in
 17415	November; and the government under it went into effect the next year.
 17416	This new constitution, in form, was very much like the famous instrument
 17417	drafted at Philadelphia in 1787. It provided for a President, a Senate,
 17418	and a House of Representatives along almost identical lines. In the
 17419	powers conferred upon them, however, there were striking differences.
 17420	The right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly
 17421	withheld; bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import
 17422	duties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry. The
 17423	dignity of the state, if any might be bold enough to question it, was
 17424	safeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted "in
 17425	its sovereign and independent character" in forming the Southern union.
 17426	
 17427	=Financing the Confederacy.=--No government ever set out upon its career
 17428	with more perplexing tasks in front of it. The North had a monetary
 17429	system; the South had to create one. The North had a scheme of taxation
 17430	that produced large revenues from numerous sources; the South had to
 17431	formulate and carry out a financial plan. Like the North, the
 17432	Confederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,
 17433	easily collected and little felt among the masses. To this expectation
 17434	the blockade of Southern ports inaugurated by Lincoln in April, 1861,
 17435	soon put an end. Following the precedent set by Congress under the
 17436	Articles of Confederation, the Southern Congress resorted to a direct
 17437	property tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that
 17438	might have been foretold.
 17439	
 17440	The Confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the
 17441	treasury nearly all the specie available in the Southern banks. This
 17442	specie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,
 17443	sapping the foundations of a sound currency system. Large amounts of
 17444	bonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those
 17445	of the North in the markets of London, Paris, and Amsterdam, many an
 17446	English lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to
 17447	lament within a few years the proofs of his folly. The difficulties of
 17448	bringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond
 17449	issues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the
 17450	Confederacy back upon the device of paper money. In all approximately
 17451	one billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value
 17452	at an alarming rate, reaching in January, 1863, the astounding figure of
 17453	fifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. Every known device was
 17454	used to prevent its depreciation, without result. To the issues of the
 17455	Confederate Congress were added untold millions poured out by the states
 17456	and by private banks.
 17457	
 17458	=Human and Material Resources.=--When we measure strength for strength
 17459	in those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to
 17460	see how the South was able to embark on secession and war with such
 17461	confidence in the outcome. In the Confederacy at the final reckoning
 17462	there were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a
 17463	population of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted
 17464	against twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce
 17465	war supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in
 17466	battle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth
 17467	eleven billion dollars. Even after the Confederate Congress authorized
 17468	conscription in 1862, Southern man power, measured in numbers, was
 17469	wholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.
 17470	How, therefore, could the Confederacy hope to sustain itself against
 17471	
 17472	such a combination of men, money, and materials as the North could
 17473	marshal?
 17474	
 17475	=Southern Expectations.=--The answer to this question is to be found in
 17476	the ideas that prevailed among Southern leaders. First of all, they
 17477	hoped, in vain, to carry the Confederacy up to the Ohio River; and, with
 17478	the aid of Missouri, to gain possession of the Mississippi Valley, the
 17479	granary of the nation. In the second place, they reckoned upon a large
 17480	and continuous trade with Great Britain--the exchange of cotton for war
 17481	materials. They likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid
 17482	from European powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of
 17483	the great American republic. In the third place, they believed that
 17484	their control over several staples so essential to Northern industry
 17485	would enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing
 17486	states. "I firmly believe," wrote Senator Hammond, of South Carolina, in
 17487	1860, "that the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the
 17488	world; that no other power would face us in hostility. Cotton, rice,
 17489	tobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to
 17490	know it and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry it out successfully. The
 17491	North without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of
 17492	mange and starvation."
 17493	
 17494	There were other grounds for confidence. Having seized all of the
 17495	federal military and naval supplies in the South, and having left the
 17496	national government weak in armed power during their possession of the
 17497	presidency, Southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,
 17498	to put the finishing stroke to independence. "The greasy mechanics of
 17499	the North," it was repeatedly said, "will not fight." As to disparity in
 17500	numbers they drew historic parallels. "Our fathers, a mere handful,
 17501	overcame the enormous power of Great Britain," a saying of ex-President
 17502	Tyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. Finally, and this point
 17503	cannot be too strongly emphasized, the South expected to see a weakened
 17504	and divided North. It knew that the abolitionists and the Southern
 17505	sympathizers were ready to let the Confederate states go in peace; that
 17506	Lincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the
 17507	country; and that the vote for Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge meant a
 17508	decided opposition to the Republicans and their policies.
 17509	
 17510	=Efforts at Compromise.=--Republican leaders, on reviewing the same
 17511	facts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and
 17512	made many efforts to avoid a crisis. Thurlow Weed, an Albany journalist
 17513	and politician who had done much to carry New York for Lincoln, proposed
 17514	a plan for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.
 17515	Jefferson Davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be
 17516	terrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but Lincoln, remembering his
 17517	campaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. His followers in
 17518	Congress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement
 17519	suggested by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky.
 17520	
 17521	Though unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in
 17522	the territories, Lincoln was prepared to give to Southern leaders a
 17523	strong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or
 17524	indirectly with slavery in the states. Anxious to reassure the South on
 17525	this point, the Republicans in Congress proposed to write into the
 17526	Constitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made
 17527	authorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.
 17528	The resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on March 4, 1861, with the
 17529	approval of Lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the
 17530	storm of war destroyed it. By the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment
 17531	was to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.
 17532	
 17533	
 17534	THE WAR MEASURES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 17535	
 17536	=Raising the Armies.=--The crisis at Fort Sumter, on April 12-14, 1861,
 17537	forced the President and Congress to turn from negotiations to problems
 17538	of warfare. Little did they realize the magnitude of the task before
 17539	them. Lincoln's first call for volunteers, issued on April 15, 1861,
 17540	limited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,
 17541	and prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against
 17542	combinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.
 17543	Disillusionment swiftly followed. The terrible defeat of the Federals at
 17544	Bull Run on July 21 revealed the serious character of the task before
 17545	them; and by a series of measures Congress put the entire man power of
 17546	the country at the President's command. Under these acts, he issued new
 17547	calls for volunteers. Early in August, 1862, he ordered a draft of
 17548	militiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months' service. The results were
 17549	disappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the
 17550	army. Something more drastic was clearly necessary.
 17551	
 17552	In March, 1863, Lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in
 17553	the national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male
 17554	citizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention
 17555	to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five
 17556	years--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.
 17557	From the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active
 17558	service. Unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of
 17559	universal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for
 17560	himself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred
 17561	dollars, to be fixed by general order. This provision, so crass and so
 17562	obviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which
 17563	sprang up a hundredfold in the North.
 17564	
 17565	[Illustration: THE DRAFT RIOTS IN NEW YORK CITY]
 17566	
 17567	The beginning of the drawings under the draft act in New York City, on
 17568	Monday, July 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. In the
 17569	course of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office
 17570	of the _Tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the
 17571	homes of obnoxious Unionists were burned down; the residence of the
 17572	mayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the
 17573	streets between the rioters and the police. Business stopped and a large
 17574	part of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. Not
 17575	until late the following Wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore
 17576	order and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily
 17577	activities. At least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and
 17578	more than a million dollars' worth of damage done to property. The draft
 17579	temporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried
 17580	out without further trouble.
 17581	
 17582	The results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the
 17583	government. The exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred
 17584	and were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.
 17585	Volunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could
 17586	hardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. With reluctance
 17587	Congress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the
 17588	well-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.
 17589	With all this power in its hands the administration was able by January,
 17590	1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the Confederates two to
 17591	one.
 17592	
 17593	=War Finance.=--In the financial sphere the North faced immense
 17594	difficulties. The surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861
 17595	and the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to
 17596	meet the ordinary expenses of the government. Confronted by military and
 17597	naval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in
 17598	the first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the
 17599	administration had to tap every available source of income. The duties
 17600	on imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge
 17601	revenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the
 17602	manufacturers for protection. Direct taxes were imposed on the states
 17603	according to their respective populations, but the returns were
 17604	meager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. Stamp taxes
 17605	and taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations
 17606	were laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth
 17607	opposition of ominous strength. The whole gamut of taxation was run.
 17608	Even a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of
 17609	the federal government, was included in the long list.
 17610	
 17611	Revenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest
 17612	rate, until in October, at the end of the war, the debt stood at
 17613	$2,208,000,000. The total cost of the war was many times the money value
 17614	of all the slaves in the Southern states. To the debt must be added
 17615	nearly half a billion dollars in "greenbacks"--paper money issued by
 17616	Congress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to
 17617	meet the rising expenditures. This currency issued at par on
 17618	questionable warrant from the Constitution, like all such paper, quickly
 17619	began to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold
 17620	was worth nearly three in greenbacks.
 17621	
 17622	=The Blockade of Southern Ports.=--Four days after his call for
 17623	volunteers, April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation
 17624	blockading the ports of the Southern Confederacy. Later the blockade was
 17625	extended to Virginia and North Carolina, as they withdrew from the
 17626	union. Vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they
 17627	disregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and
 17628	brought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. To make the order
 17629	effective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,
 17630	depleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such
 17631	a number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the
 17632	gantlet. The collision between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ in
 17633	March, 1862, sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The exploits of the
 17634	union navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in
 17635	1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.
 17636	
 17637	The deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon Southern war power may
 17638	be readily imagined. Foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be
 17639	negotiated but not paid off. Supplies could be purchased on credit but
 17640	not brought through the drag net. With extreme difficulty could the
 17641	Confederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and
 17642	bonds. Publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally
 17643	driven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. As the
 17644	railways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them
 17645	from England or France. Unable to export their cotton, planters on the
 17646	seaboard burned it in what were called "fires of patriotism." In their
 17647	lurid light the fatal weakness of Southern economy stood revealed.
 17648	
 17649	[Illustration: A BLOCKADE RUNNER]
 17650	
 17651	=Diplomacy.=--The war had not advanced far before the federal government
 17652	became involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in Europe. The
 17653	Confederacy early turned to England and France for financial aid and for
 17654	recognition as an independent power. Davis believed that the industrial
 17655	crisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel
 17656	Europe to intervene in order to get this essential staple. The crisis
 17657	came as he expected but not the result. Thousands of English textile
 17658	workers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of
 17659	starvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the North instead of
 17660	petitioning their government to aid the South by breaking the blockade.
 17661	
 17662	With the ruling classes it was far otherwise. Napoleon III, the Emperor
 17663	of the French, was eager to help in disrupting the American republic; if
 17664	he could have won England's support, he would have carried out his
 17665	designs. As it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the Channel
 17666	but not open and official cooperation. According to the eminent
 17667	historian, Rhodes, "four-fifths of the British House of Lords and most
 17668	members of the House of Commons were favorable to the Confederacy and
 17669	anxious for its triumph." Late in 1862 the British ministers, thus
 17670	sustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the
 17671	Confederacy. Had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant
 17672	and harassing criticism by English friends of the United States--like
 17673	John Bright--and for the victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, both
 17674	
 17675	England and France would have doubtless declared the Confederacy to be
 17676	one of the independent powers of the earth.
 17677	
 17678	[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT]
 17679	
 17680	While stopping short of recognizing its independence, England and France
 17681	took several steps that were in favor of the South. In proclaiming
 17682	neutrality, they early accepted the Confederates as "belligerents" and
 17683	accorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger
 17684	in the North at first but was later admitted to be sound. Otherwise
 17685	Confederates taken in battle would have been regarded as "rebels" or
 17686	"traitors" to be hanged or shot. Napoleon III proposed to Russia in 1861
 17687	a coalition of powers against the North, only to meet a firm refusal.
 17688	The next year he suggested intervention to Great Britain, encountering
 17689	this time a conditional rejection of his plans. In 1863, not daunted by
 17690	rebuffs, he offered his services to Lincoln as a mediator, receiving in
 17691	reply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from
 17692	Congress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.
 17693	
 17694	In both England and France the governments pursued a policy of
 17695	friendliness to the Confederate agents. The British ministry, with
 17696	indifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in
 17697	British docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the
 17698	Confederate flag with American commerce. One of them, the _Alabama_,
 17699	built in Liverpool by a British firm and paid for by bonds sold in
 17700	England, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the
 17701	blockade. The course followed by the British government, against the
 17702	protests of the American minister in London, was later regretted. By an
 17703	award of a tribunal of arbitration at Geneva in 1872, Great Britain was
 17704	required to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought
 17705	by Confederate cruisers fitted out in England.
 17706	
 17707	[Illustration: WILLIAM H. SEWARD]
 17708	
 17709	In all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the North
 17710	contributed to the irritation between the two countries. Seward, the
 17711	Secretary of State, was vindictive in dealing with Great Britain; had it
 17712	not been for the moderation of Lincoln, he would have pursued a course
 17713	verging in the direction of open war. The New York and Boston papers
 17714	were severe in their attacks on England. Words were, on one occasion at
 17715	least, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. In November,
 17716	1861, Captain Wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the British
 17717	steamer _Trent_, and carried off by force two Confederate agents, Mason
 17718	and Slidell, sent by President Davis to represent the Confederacy at
 17719	London and Paris respectively. This was a clear violation of the right
 17720	of merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in
 17721	answer to the demand of Great Britain for the release of the two men,
 17722	the United States conceded that it was in the wrong. It surrendered the
 17723	two Confederate agents to a British vessel for safe conduct abroad, and
 17724	made appropriate apologies.
 17725	
 17726	=Emancipation.=--Among the extreme war measures adopted by the Northern
 17727	government must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states
 17728	in arms against the union. This step was early and repeatedly suggested
 17729	to Lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. He knew
 17730	that the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might
 17731	drive the border states into secession, and that the Northern soldiers
 17732	had enlisted to save the union. Moreover, he had before him a solemn
 17733	resolution passed by Congress on July 22, 1861, declaring the sole
 17734	purpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any
 17735	intention of interfering with slavery.
 17736	
 17737	The federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,
 17738	soon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.
 17739	Before a year had elapsed, namely on April 10, 1862, Congress resolved
 17740	that financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual
 17741	emancipation. Six days later it abolished slavery in the District of
 17742	Columbia. Two short months elapsed. On June 19, 1862, it swept slavery
 17743	forever from the territories of the United States. Chief Justice Taney
 17744	still lived, the Dred Scott decision stood as written in the book, but
 17745	the Constitution had been re-read in the light of the Civil War. The
 17746	drift of public sentiment in the North was being revealed.
 17747	
 17748	While these measures were pending in Congress, Lincoln was slowly making
 17749	up his mind. By July of that year he had come to his great decision.
 17750	Near the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a
 17751	proclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military
 17752	achievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. In
 17753	September, the severe check administered to Lee at Antietam seemed to
 17754	offer the golden opportunity. On the 22d, the immortal document was
 17755	given to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned
 17756	to the union by January 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their "peculiar
 17757	institution" would be delivered. Southern leaders treated it with slight
 17758	regard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. The
 17759	proclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the President as
 17760	commander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military
 17761	necessity. It did not abolish slavery. It simply emancipated slaves in
 17762	places then in arms against federal authority. Everywhere else slavery,
 17763	as far as the Proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.
 17764	
 17765	[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN]
 17766	
 17767	To seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom
 17768	to the whole country, Congress, in January, 1865, on the urgent
 17769	recommendation of Lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth
 17770	amendment, abolishing slavery throughout the United States. By the end
 17771	of 1865 the amendment was ratified. The house was not divided against
 17772	itself; it did not fall; it was all free.
 17773	
 17774	=The Restraint of Civil Liberty.=--As in all great wars, particularly
 17775	those in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use
 17776	strong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration's
 17777	military policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to
 17778	hamper its action. Within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,
 17779	Lincoln empowered General Scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_
 17780	along the line of march between Philadelphia and Washington and thus to
 17781	arrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he
 17782	deemed a menace to the union. At a later date the area thus ruled by
 17783	military officers was extended by executive proclamation. By an act of
 17784	March 3, 1863, Congress, desiring to lay all doubts about the
 17785	President's power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the
 17786	United States or in any part thereof. It also freed military officers
 17787	from the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested
 17788	under their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such
 17789	courts. In the autumn of that year the President, acting under the terms
 17790	of this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the
 17791	protection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout
 17792	the length and breadth of the land. The power of the government was also
 17793	strengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,
 17794	passed on July 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on
 17795	those who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the
 17796	execution of the law.
 17797	
 17798	Thus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of
 17799	active sympathy with the Southern cause. Editors were arrested and
 17800	imprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. Those
 17801	who organized "peace meetings" soon found themselves in the toils of the
 17802	law. Members of the Maryland legislature, the mayor of Baltimore, and
 17803	local editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were
 17804	imprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were
 17805	denied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate. A Vermont
 17806	farmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself
 17807	behind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to
 17808	release him. These measures were not confined to the theater of war nor
 17809	to the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to
 17810	endanger the cause of union. They were applied all through the Northern
 17811	states up to the very boundaries of Canada. Zeal for the national cause,
 17812	too often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among
 17813	those who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.
 17814	
 17815	These drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign
 17816	to the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and
 17817	bitter hostility. Meetings of protest were held throughout the country.
 17818	Thirty-six members of the House of Representatives sought to put on
 17819	record their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,
 17820	only to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. Chief Justice
 17821	Taney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the President's
 17822	military authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and
 17823	learned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the President
 17824	had no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. In Congress and
 17825	out, Democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced
 17826	Lincoln and his Cabinet in unsparing terms. Vallandigham, a Democratic
 17827	leader of Ohio, afterward banished to the South for his opposition to
 17828	the war, constantly applied to Lincoln the epithet of "Caesar." Wendell
 17829	Phillips saw in him "a more unlimited despot than the world knows this
 17830	side of China."
 17831	
 17832	Sensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,
 17833	Lincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many
 17834	political prisoners. The general policy, however, he defended in homely
 17835	language, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning
 17836	of the lawyers. "Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,
 17837	while I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to
 17838	desert?" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who
 17839	protested against arresting people for "talking against the war." This
 17840	summed up his philosophy. He was engaged in a war to save the union, and
 17841	all measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were
 17842	warranted by the Constitution which he had sworn to uphold.
 17843	
 17844	=Military Strategy--North and South.=--The broad outlines of military
 17845	strategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear
 17846	even to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a
 17847	campaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.
 17848	The problem for the South was one of defense mainly, though even for
 17849	defense swift and paralyzing strokes at the North were later deemed
 17850	imperative measures. The problem of the North was, to put it baldly, one
 17851	of invasion and conquest. Southern territory had to be invaded and
 17852	Southern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion
 17853	there.
 17854	
 17855	In the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a
 17856	significant part in the disposition of forces. The Appalachian ranges,
 17857	stretching through the Confederacy to Northern Alabama, divided the
 17858	campaigns into Eastern and Western enterprises. Both were of signal
 17859	importance. Victory in the East promised the capture of the Confederate
 17860	capital of Richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be
 17861	overestimated. Victory in the West meant severing the Confederacy and
 17862	opening the Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf.
 17863	
 17864	As it turned out, the Western forces accomplished their task first,
 17865	vindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the
 17866	confidence of opposing commanders. In February, 1862, Grant captured
 17867	Fort Donelson on the Tennessee River, rallied wavering unionists in
 17868	Kentucky, forced the evacuation of Nashville, and opened the way for two
 17869	hundred miles into the Confederacy. At Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Vicksburg,
 17870	Chickamauga, Chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of
 17871	varying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of
 17872	Confederate forces to the Southeast into Georgia. By the middle of 1863,
 17873	the Mississippi Valley was open to the Gulf, the initiative taken out of
 17874	the hands of Southern commanders in the West, and the way prepared for
 17875	Sherman's final stroke--the march from Atlanta to the sea--a maneuver
 17876	executed with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.

 17880	[Illustration: GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE]
 17881	
 17882	For the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the West by
 17883	Generals Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and Hooker against Albert Sidney
 17884	Johnston, Bragg, Pemberton, and Hood, the union forces in the East
 17885	offered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and
 17886	disasters. Far from capturing Richmond, they had been thrown on the
 17887	defensive. General after general--McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, and
 17888	Meade--was tried and found wanting. None of them could administer a
 17889	crushing defeat to the Confederate troops and more than once the union
 17890	soldiers were beaten in a fair battle. They did succeed, however, in
 17891	delivering a severe check to advancing Confederates under General Robert
 17892	E. Lee, first at Antietam in September, 1862, and then at Gettysburg in
 17893	July, 1863--checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the
 17894	Confederates escaped without demoralization. Not until the beginning of
 17895	the next year, when General Grant, supplied with almost unlimited men
 17896	and munitions, began his irresistible hammering at Lee's army, did the
 17897	final phase of the war commence. The pitiless drive told at last.
 17898	General Lee, on April 9, 1865, seeing the futility of further conflict,
 17899	surrendered an army still capable of hard fighting, at Appomattox, not
 17900	far from the capital of the Confederacy.

 17904	THE FEDERAL MILITARY HOSPITAL AT GETTYSBURG]
 17905	
 17906	=Abraham Lincoln.=--The services of Lincoln to the cause of union defy
 17907	description. A judicial scrutiny of the war reveals his thought and
 17908	planning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned
 17909	Northern arms with victory. Is it in the field of diplomacy? Does
 17910	Seward, the Secretary of State, propose harsh and caustic measures
 17911	likely to draw England's sword into the scale? Lincoln counsels
 17912	moderation. He takes the irritating message and with his own hand
 17913	strikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words
 17914	that sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. Is it a matter
 17915	of compromise with the South, so often proposed by men on both sides
 17916	sick of carnage? Lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only
 17917	when he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of
 17918	the union. Is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best
 17919	fitted to win Gettysburg--Hooker, Sedgwick, or Meade? Lincoln goes in
 17920	person to the War Department in the dead of night to take counsel with
 17921	his Secretary and to make the fateful choice.
 17922	
 17923	Is it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil
 17924	liberties unjustly or in violation of the Constitution? Lincoln is ready
 17925	to hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.
 17926	Is a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a
 17927	deserter? Lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the
 17928	protests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. Do
 17929	politicians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? Lincoln
 17930	grandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think
 17931	of the greater cause. Is it a question of securing votes to ratify the
 17932	thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? Lincoln thinks it not beneath
 17933	his dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling
 17934	jobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. Does a New
 17935	York newspaper call him an ignorant Western boor? Lincoln's reply is a
 17936	letter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of
 17937	battle--and an address at Gettysburg, both of which will live as long as
 17938	the tongue in which they were written. These are tributes not only to
 17939	his mastery of the English language but also to his mastery of all those
 17940	sentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of
 17941	culture.
 17942	
 17943	Throughout the entire span of service, however, Lincoln was beset by
 17944	merciless critics. The fiery apostles of abolition accused him of
 17945	cowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. Anti-war Democrats
 17946	lashed out at every step he took. Even in his own party he found no
 17947	peace. Charles Sumner complained: "Our President is now dictator,
 17948	_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a
 17949	god and not to use it godlike." Leaders among the Republicans sought to
 17950	put him aside in 1864 and place Chase in his chair. "I hope we may never
 17951	have a worse man," was Lincoln's quiet answer.
 17952	
 17953	Wide were the dissensions in the North during that year and the
 17954	Republicans, while selecting Lincoln as their candidate again, cast off
 17955	their old name and chose the simple title of the "Union party."
 17956	Moreover, they selected a Southern man, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, to
 17957	be associated with him as candidate for Vice President. This combination
 17958	the Northern Democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that
 17959	"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of
 17960	war, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power
 17961	higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been
 17962	disregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike
 17963	trodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand
 17964	that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the
 17965	end that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the
 17966	states." It is true that the Democratic candidate, General McClellan,
 17967	sought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that
 17968	he could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their
 17969	efforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate Lincoln and
 17970	his works had gone forth. The response came, giving Lincoln 2,200,000
 17971	votes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. The bitter things said about
 17972	him during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. When in April, 1865, he
 17973	was struck down by the assassin's hand, he above all others in
 17974	Washington was planning measures of moderation and healing.
 17975	
 17976	
 17977	THE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL WAR
 17978	
 17979	There is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress
 17980	the dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history
 17981	requires us to include all other significant phases as well. Like every
 17982	great armed conflict, the Civil War outran the purposes of those who
 17983	took part in it. Waged over the nature of the union, it made a
 17984	revolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional
 17985	principles and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.
 17986	
 17987	=The Supremacy of the Union.=--First and foremost, the war settled for
 17988	all time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. The
 17989	doctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. Men might still speak of
 17990	the rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,
 17991	but nullification and secession were destroyed. The nation was supreme.
 17992	
 17993	=The Destruction of the Slave Power.=--Next to the vindication of
 17994	national supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of
 17995	the South--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted
 17996	ability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial
 17997	interests of the North. The first paralyzing blow at the planters was
 17998	struck by the abolition of slavery. The second and third came with the
 17999	fourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to
 18000	freedmen and excluding from public office the Confederate
 18001	leaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of
 18002	the South. As if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth
 18003	amendment forbade the United States or any state to pay any debts
 18004	incurred in aid of the Confederacy or in the emancipation of the
 18005	slaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the Southern financiers who had
 18006	stripped their section of capital to support their cause. So the
 18007	Southern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled
 18008	over by their former bondmen under the tutelage of Republican leaders.
 18009	Their labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as
 18010	worthless as waste paper. The South was subject to the North. That which
 18011	neither the Federalists nor the Whigs had been able to accomplish in the
 18012	realm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.
 18013	
 18014	
 18015	=The Triumph of Industry.=--The wreck of the planting system was
 18016	accompanied by a mighty upswing of Northern industry which made the old
 18017	Whigs of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania stare in wonderment. The demands
 18018	of the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices
 18019	gave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of
 18020	the South. Between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing
 18021	establishments increased 79.6 per cent as against 14.2 for the previous
 18022	decade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. There was
 18023	no doubt about the future of American industry.
 18024	
 18025	=The Victory for the Protective Tariff.=--Moreover, it was henceforth to
 18026	be well protected. For many years before the war the friends of
 18027	protection had been on the defensive. The tariff act of 1857 imposed
 18028	duties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. The war changed
 18029	all that. The extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes
 18030	on all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of Clay or
 18031	Webster might well have gasped with astonishment. After the war was over
 18032	the debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.
 18033	Protective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a
 18034	plain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.
 18035	
 18036	=A Liberal Immigration Policy.=--Linked with industry was the labor
 18037	supply. The problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and
 18038	Republican leaders grappled with it. In the platform of the Union party
 18039	adopted in 1864 it was declared "that foreign immigration, which in the
 18040	past has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and
 18041	the increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all
 18042	nations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just
 18043	policy." In that very year Congress, recognizing the importance of the
 18044	problem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of
 18045	immigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by
 18046	making it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay
 18047	their passage over. Though the bill was soon repealed, the practice
 18048	authorized by it was long continued. The cheapness of the passage
 18049	shortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the
 18050	days of William Penn.
 18051	
 18052	=The Homestead Act of 1862.=--In the immigration measure guaranteeing a
 18053	continuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to
 18054	the Homestead Act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. The Homestead
 18055	law they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.
 18056	Naturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away
 18057	from the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher
 18058	wages as the price of remaining. Southern planters likewise had feared
 18059	free homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add
 18060	to the overbalancing power of the North.
 18061	
 18062	In spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made
 18063	steady gains. Free-soil Democrats,--Jacksonian farmers and
 18064	mechanics,--labor reformers, and political leaders, like Stephen A.
 18065	Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, kept up the
 18066	agitation in season and out. More than once were they able to force a
 18067	homestead bill through the House of Representatives only to have it
 18068	blocked in the Senate where Southern interests were intrenched. Then,
 18069	after the Senate was won over, a Democratic President, James Buchanan,
 18070	vetoed the bill. Still the issue lived. The Republicans, strong among
 18071	the farmers of the Northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed
 18072	it upon the attention of the country. Finally the manufacturers yielded;
 18073	they received their compensation in the contract labor law. In 1862
 18074	Congress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots
 18075	among men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build
 18076	their serried lines of homesteads to the Rockies and beyond.
 18077	
 18078	=Internal Improvements.=--If farmers and manufacturers were early
 18079	divided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said
 18080	of internal improvements. The Western tiller of the soil was as eager
 18081	for some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer
 18082	was for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the
 18083	farm. While the Confederate leaders were writing into their
 18084	constitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal
 18085	improvements, the Republican leaders at Washington were planning such
 18086	expenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to
 18087	railways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half
 18088	a century earlier.
 18089	
 18090	=Sound Finance--National Banking.=--From Hamilton's day to Lincoln's,
 18091	business men in the East had contended for a sound system of national
 18092	currency. The experience of the states with paper money, painfully
 18093	impressive in the years before the framing of the Constitution, had been
 18094	convincing to those who understood the economy of business. The
 18095	Constitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. States
 18096	were forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. This
 18097	provision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had
 18098	circumvented it in the age of Jacksonian Democracy. The states had
 18099	enacted and the Supreme Court, after the death of John Marshall, had
 18100	sustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to
 18101	issue paper money. So the country was beset by the old curse, the banks
 18102	of Western and Southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help
 18103	borrowers pay their debts.
 18104	
 18105	In dealing with war finances, the Republicans attacked this ancient
 18106	evil. By act of Congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national
 18107	banks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue
 18108	notes. The next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the
 18109	authority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. In this way, by
 18110	two measures Congress restored federal control over the monetary system
 18111	although it did not reestablish the United States Bank so hated by
 18112	Jacksonian Democracy.
 18113	
 18114	=Destruction of States' Rights by Fourteenth Amendment.=--These acts and
 18115	others not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation
 18116	at the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. They were all of
 18117	high import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth
 18118	amendment which, among other things, forbade states to "deprive any
 18119	person of life, liberty or property without due process of law." The
 18120	immediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was
 18121	the need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile
 18122	legislatures in the South. The result of the amendment, as was
 18123	prophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the
 18124	Democratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,
 18125	and county authorities to possible annulment by the Supreme Court at
 18126	Washington. The expected happened.
 18127	
 18128	Few negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the
 18129	attention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal
 18130	ordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and
 18131	void under it. Laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of
 18132	labor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be
 18133	annulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be
 18134	designed solely for the protection of negroes. As centralized power over
 18135	tariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to
 18136	Congress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local
 18137	authorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights
 18138	was conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the
 18139	Supreme Court at Washington. Thus the old federation of "independent
 18140	states," all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the "jewel of
 18141	sovereignty" so celebrated in Southern oratory, had gone the way of all
 18142	flesh under the withering blasts of Civil War.
 18143	
 18144	
 18145	RECONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTH
 18146	
 18147	=Theories about the Position of the Seceded States.=--On the morning of
 18148	April 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered his army to General Grant,
 18149	eleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared
 18150	perpetual. Lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and
 18151	had been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the
 18152	former Confederacy. Radical Republicans held that they were "conquered
 18153	provinces" at the mercy of Congress, to be governed under such laws as
 18154	it saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or
 18155	all of them to the union. Men of more conservative views held that, as
 18156	the war had been waged by the North on the theory that no state could
 18157	secede from the union, the Confederate states had merely attempted to
 18158	withdraw and had failed. The corollary of this latter line of argument
 18159	was simple: "The Southern states are still in the union and it is the
 18160	duty of the President, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal
 18161	troops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to
 18162	function once more as usual."
 18163	
 18164	=Lincoln's Proposal.=--Some such simple and conservative form of
 18165	reconstruction had been suggested by Lincoln in a proclamation of
 18166	December 8, 1863. He proposed pardon and a restoration of property,
 18167	except in slaves, to nearly all who had "directly or by implication
 18168	participated in the existing rebellion," on condition that they take an
 18169	oath of loyalty to the union. He then announced that when, in any of the
 18170	states named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood
 18171	before secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in
 18172	1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to
 18173	reestablish a state government. Such a government, he added, should be
 18174	recognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the
 18175	federal Constitution. With reference to the status of the former slaves
 18176	Lincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he
 18177	would not object to any legislation "which may yet be consistent as a
 18178	temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,
 18179	landless, and homeless class."
 18180	
 18181	=Andrew Johnson's Plan--His Impeachment.=--Lincoln's successor, Andrew
 18182	Johnson, the Vice President, soon after taking office, proposed to
 18183	pursue a somewhat similar course. In a number of states he appointed
 18184	military governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to
 18185	assemble conventions, chosen "by that portion of the people of the said
 18186	states who are loyal to the United States," and proceed to the
 18187	organization of regular civil government. Johnson, a Southern man and a
 18188	Democrat, was immediately charged by the Republicans with being too
 18189	ready to restore the Southern states. As the months went by, the
 18190	opposition to his measures and policies in Congress grew in size and
 18191	bitterness. The contest resulted in the impeachment of Johnson by the
 18192	House of Representatives in March, 1868, and his acquittal by the Senate
 18193	merely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required
 18194	for conviction.
 18195	
 18196	=Congress Enacts "Reconstruction Laws."=--In fact, Congress was in a
 18197	strategic position. It was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,
 18198	determine the conditions under which Senators and Representatives from
 18199	the South were to be readmitted. It therefore proceeded to pass a series
 18200	of reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over Johnson's veto. These
 18201	measures, the first of which became a law on March 2, 1867, betrayed an
 18202	animus not found anywhere in Lincoln's plans or Johnson's proclamations.
 18203	
 18204	They laid off the ten states--the whole Confederacy with the exception
 18205	of Tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each
 18206	commanded by a military officer appointed by the President. They ordered
 18207	the commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election
 18208	of delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new
 18209	constitutions. Such voters, however, were not to be, as Lincoln had
 18210	suggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before
 18211	secession but "the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and
 18212	upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such
 18213	as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony
 18214	at common law." This was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of
 18215	the Confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share
 18216	in the establishment of the new order. Power was thus arbitrarily thrust
 18217	into the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of
 18218	whites who could show a record of loyalty. That was not all. Each state
 18219	was, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth
 18220	amendment to the federal Constitution as a price of restoration to the
 18221	union.
 18222	
 18223	The composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.
 18224	Bondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the
 18225	governing power. An army of adventurers from the North, "carpet baggers"
 18226	as they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in
 18227	"reconstruction." Undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave
 18228	unstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only
 18229	aggravated the open wound left by the war. Any number of political
 18230	doctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be
 18231	found. Under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the Southern
 18232	states were one after another restored to the union by the grace of
 18233	Congress, the last one in 1870. Even this grudging concession of the
 18234	formalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and
 18235	privileges. The last soldier was not withdrawn from the last Southern
 18236	capital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as
 18237	a sign of congressional supremacy.
 18238	
 18239	=The Status of the Freedmen.=--Even more intricate than the issues
 18240	involved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question
 18241	of what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. That problem, often put
 18242	to abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. The
 18243	thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. It
 18244	declared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or
 18245	homes and did not mention the subject of political rights. All these
 18246	matters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,
 18247	by their famous "black codes," restored a form of servitude under the
 18248	guise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. Such methods were in fact partly
 18249	responsible for the reaction that led Congress to abandon Lincoln's
 18250	policies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.
 18251	
 18252	Still no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems
 18253	of the bondmen. Radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when
 18254	emancipated should be given outright the fields of their former
 18255	masters; but Congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.
 18256	The necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865
 18257	the Freedmen's Bureau to take care of refugees. It authorized the issue
 18258	of food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and
 18259	certain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable
 18260	rates. But the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the
 18261	land, it left to the slow working of time.
 18262	
 18263	Against sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the
 18264	Democrats, Congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen
 18265	certain rights by national law. These rights fell into broad divisions,
 18266	civil and political. By an act passed in 1866, Congress gave to former
 18267	slaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,
 18268	giving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing
 18269	property. As it was doubtful whether Congress had the power to enact
 18270	this law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth
 18271	amendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the
 18272	privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and declared
 18273	that no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or
 18274	property without due process of law. Not yet satisfied, Congress
 18275	attempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights
 18276	bill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and
 18277	equal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of
 18278	amusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
 18279	
 18280	The matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the
 18281	radical Republicans, like Charles Sumner, asserted that civil rights
 18282	were not secure unless supported by the suffrage. In this same
 18283	fourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro
 18284	men, leaving the women to take care of themselves. The amendment
 18285	declared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of
 18286	the right to vote, its representation in Congress should be reduced in
 18287	the proportion such persons bore to the voting population.
 18288	
 18289	This provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth
 18290	amendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen
 18291	should be deprived of the right to vote "on account of race, color, or
 18292	previous condition of servitude." To make assurance doubly secure,
 18293	Congress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes
 18294	known as "force bills," providing for the use of federal authorities,
 18295	civil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the Union.
 18296	So the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by
 18297	legal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and
 18298	political. Never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of Greece
 18299	or Rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social
 18300	revolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.
 18301	
 18302	
 18303	SUMMARY OF THE SECTIONAL CONFLICT
 18304	
 18305	Just as the United States, under the impetus of Western enterprise,
 18306	rounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was
 18307	challenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. This storm
 18308	had been long gathering upon the horizon. From the very beginning in
 18309	colonial times there had been a marked difference between the South and
 18310	the North. The former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting
 18311	system--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in
 18312	the course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. The
 18313	North, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,
 18314	and manufacturing. Slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. An
 18315	abundant supply of free labor kept the Northern wheels turning.
 18316	
 18317	This difference between the two sections, early noted by close
 18318	observers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the
 18319	factory system. Between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took
 18320	place in the North. Its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations
 18321	of industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and
 18322	prosperous banks. Finding an unfavorable reception in the South, the new
 18323	industrial system was confined mainly to the North. By canals and
 18324	railways New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were linked with the
 18325	wheatfields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. A steel net wove North and
 18326	Northwest together. A commercial net supplemented it. Western trade was
 18327	diverted from New Orleans to the East and Eastern credit sustained
 18328	Western enterprise.
 18329	
 18330	In time, the industrial North and the planting South evolved different
 18331	ideas of political policy. The former looked with favor on protective
 18332	tariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal
 18333	improvements. The farmers of the West demanded that the public domain be
 18334	divided up into free homesteads for farmers. The South steadily swung
 18335	around to the opposite view. Its spokesmen came to regard most of these
 18336	policies as injurious to the planting interests.
 18337	
 18338	The economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. The Northern
 18339	states, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished
 18340	the institution. In the course of a few years there appeared
 18341	uncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. Far and wide the
 18342	agitation spread. The South was thoroughly frightened. It demanded
 18343	protection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the
 18344	case of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new
 18345	territories.
 18346	
 18347	With the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased
 18348	in bitterness. It flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the Missouri
 18349	compromise. It took on the form of a tariff controversy and
 18350	nullification in 1832. It appeared again after the Mexican war when the
 18351	question of slavery in the new territories was raised. Again
 18352	compromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only
 18353	to prove an illusion. A series of startling events swept the country
 18354	into war: the repeal of the Missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the
 18355	Republican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the
 18356	territories, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas
 18357	debates, John Brown's raid, the election of Lincoln, and secession.
 18358	
 18359	The Civil War, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both North
 18360	and South, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material
 18361	resources, in industry, and in armed forces. By the blockade of Southern
 18362	ports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless
 18363	hammering on the field of battle, the North was victorious.
 18364	
 18365	The results of the war were revolutionary in character. Slavery was
 18366	abolished and the freedmen given the ballot. The Southern planters who
 18367	had been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost
 18368	to a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. The union was
 18369	declared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by
 18370	the judgment of battle. Federal control over the affairs of states,
 18371	counties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. The
 18372	power and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond
 18373	imagination. The North was now free to pursue its economic policies: a
 18374	protective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,
 18375	free lands for farmers. Planting had dominated the country for nearly a
 18376	generation. Business enterprise was to take its place.

 18493	
 18494	THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION OF THE SOUTH
 18495	
 18496	
 18497	The outcome of the Civil War in the South was nothing short of a
 18498	revolution. The ruling class, the law, and the government of the old
 18499	order had been subverted. To political chaos was added the havoc wrought
 18500	in agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. And
 18501	as if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was
 18502	committed to political leaders from another section of the country,
 18503	strangers to the life and traditions of the South.
 18504	
 18505	
 18506	THE SOUTH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
 18507	
 18508	=A Ruling Class Disfranchised.=--As the sovereignty of the planters had
 18509	been the striking feature of the old regime, so their ruin was the
 18510	outstanding fact of the new. The situation was extraordinary. The
 18511	American Revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of
 18512	self-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general
 18513	course to which they had long been accustomed. The French Revolution
 18514	witnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle
 18515	classes who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence
 18516	and wealth.
 18517	
 18518	The Southern Revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. It was
 18519	not brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. It
 18520	did not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but
 18521	bondmen who had played no part in the struggle. Moreover it struck down
 18522	a class equipped to rule. The leading planters were almost to a man
 18523	excluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment
 18524	was a bar to their return. All civil and military places under the
 18525	authority of the United States and of the states were closed to every
 18526	man who had taken an oath to support the Constitution as a member of
 18527	Congress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and
 18528	afterward engaged in "insurrection or rebellion," or "given aid and
 18529	comfort to the enemies" of the United States. This sweeping provision,
 18530	supplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the
 18531	talent, energy, and spirit of the South.
 18532	
 18533	=The Condition of the State Governments.=--The legislative, executive,
 18534	and judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the
 18535	control of former slaves, led principally by Northern adventurers or
 18536	Southern novices, known as "Scalawags." The result was a carnival of
 18537	waste, folly, and corruption. The "reconstruction" assembly of South
 18538	Carolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. To
 18539	purchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;
 18540	and swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state
 18541	at five times the cost. In the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of
 18542	the state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the
 18543	increase could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for
 18544	it.
 18545	
 18546	=Economic Ruin--Urban and Rural.=--No matter where Southern men turned
 18547	in 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along
 18548	the highways. Atlanta, the city to which Sherman applied the torch, lay
 18549	in ashes; Nashville and Chattanooga had been partially wrecked; Richmond
 18550	and Augusta had suffered severely from fires. Charleston was described
 18551	by a visitor as "a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of
 18552	rotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of
 18553	grass-grown streets.... How few young men there are, how generally the
 18554	young women are dressed in black! The flower of their proud aristocracy
 18555	is buried on scores of battle fields."
 18556	
 18557	Those who journeyed through the country about the same time reported
 18558	desolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. An English traveler
 18559	who made his way along the course of the Tennessee River in 1870 wrote:
 18560	"The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin
 18561	houses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of
 18562	once cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. The
 18563	roads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become
 18564	impassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields
 18565	without much respect to boundaries." Many a great plantation had been
 18566	confiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in
 18567	Confederate service. Many more lay in waste. In the wake of the armies
 18568	the homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been
 18569	despoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.
 18570	
 18571	=Railways Dilapidated.=--Transportation was still more demoralized. This
 18572	is revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand
 18573	investigations. One eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. From
 18574	Pocahontas to Decatur, Alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,
 18575	the railroad was "almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and
 18576	iron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and
 18577	trestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks
 18578	gone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line
 18579	and the labor system of the country gone. About forty miles of the track
 18580	were burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and
 18581	twisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a
 18582	large portion of them requiring renewal."
 18583	
 18584	=Capital and Credit Destroyed.=--The fluid capital of the South, money
 18585	and credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.
 18586	The Confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly
 18587	collapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. The bonds of the
 18588	Confederate government were equally valueless. Specie had nearly
 18589	disappeared from circulation. The fourteenth amendment to the federal
 18590	Constitution had made all "debts, obligations, and claims" incurred in
 18591	aid of the Confederate cause "illegal and void." Millions of dollars
 18592	owed to Northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was
 18593	pressed upon the debtors. Where such debts were secured by mortgages on
 18594	land, executions against the property could be obtained in federal
 18595	courts.
 18596	
 18597	
 18598	THE RESTORATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY
 18599	
 18600	=Intimidation.=--In both politics and economics, the process of
 18601	reconstruction in the South was slow and arduous. The first battle in
 18602	the political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of
 18603	legislatures and the courts of law. It was waged, in the main, by secret
 18604	organizations, among which the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia were
 18605	the most prominent. The first of these societies appeared in Tennessee
 18606	in 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. It
 18607	was in origin a social club. According to its announcement, its objects
 18608	were "to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the
 18609	indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the
 18610	brutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans
 18611	of the Confederate soldiers." The whole South was called "the Empire"
 18612	and was ruled by a "Grand Wizard." Each state was a realm and each
 18613	county a province. In the secret orders there were enrolled over half a
 18614	million men.
 18615	
 18616	The methods of the Ku Klux and the White Camelia were similar. Solemn
 18617	parades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,
 18618	sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. Notices
 18619	were sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.
 18620	If warning failed, something more convincing was tried. Fright was the
 18621	emotion most commonly stirred. A horseman, at the witching hour of
 18622	midnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head
 18623	gear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the
 18624	request that he hold it for a few minutes. Frequently violence was
 18625	employed either officially or unofficially by members of the Klan. Tar
 18626	and feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on
 18627	unmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. Often the
 18628	members were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift
 18629	retaliation followed. So alarming did the clashes become that in 1870
 18630	Congress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the
 18631	purpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal
 18632	law.
 18633	
 18634	In anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,
 18635	the Ku Klux was officially dissolved by the "Grand Wizard" in 1869.
 18636	Nevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and
 18637	methods. The spirit survived the national association. "On the whole,"
 18638	says a Southern writer, "it is not easy to see what other course was
 18639	open to the South.... Armed resistance was out of the question. And yet
 18640	there must be some control had of the situation.... If force was denied,
 18641	craft was inevitable."
 18642	
 18643	=The Struggle for the Ballot Box.=--The effects of intimidation were
 18644	soon seen at elections. The freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the
 18645	ballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the
 18646	exercise of his new rights. He had not attained them by a long and
 18647	laborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should
 18648	battle for the privilege of using them. The mere show of force, the mere
 18649	existence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at
 18650	the polls. Thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. Nothing
 18651	could prevent it. Congress enacted force bills establishing federal
 18652	supervision of elections and the Northern politicians protested against
 18653	the return of former Confederates to practical, if not official, power;
 18654	but all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.
 18655	
 18656	=Amnesty for Southerners.=--The recovery of white supremacy in this way
 18657	was quickly felt in national councils. The Democratic party in the North
 18658	welcomed it as a sign of its return to power. The more moderate
 18659	Republicans, anxious to heal the breach in American unity, sought to
 18660	encourage rather than to repress it. So it came about that amnesty for
 18661	Confederates was widely advocated. Yet it must be said that the struggle
 18662	for the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. Lincoln, with
 18663	characteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general
 18664	proclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the
 18665	Union, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but Johnson,
 18666	vindictive toward Southern leaders and determined to make "treason
 18667	infamous," had extended the list of exceptions. Congress, even more
 18668	relentless in its pursuit of Confederates, pushed through the fourteenth
 18669	amendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.
 18670	
 18671	To appeals for comprehensive clemency, Congress was at first adamant. In
 18672	vain did men like Carl Schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their
 18673	victory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.
 18674	Congress would not yield. It would grant amnesty in individual cases;
 18675	for the principle of proscription it stood fast. When finally in 1872,
 18676	seven years after the surrender at Appomattox, it did pass the general
 18677	amnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. Confederates who had
 18678	been members of Congress just before the war, or had served in other
 18679	high posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still
 18680	excluded from important offices. Not until the summer of 1898, when the
 18681	war with Spain produced once more a union of hearts, did Congress relent
 18682	and abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the Confederates.
 18683	
 18684	=The Force Bills Attacked and Nullified.=--The granting of amnesty
 18685	encouraged the Democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.
 18686	In 1874 they captured the House of Representatives and declared war on
 18687	the "force bills." As a Republican Senate blocked immediate repeal, they
 18688	resorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. To the appropriation bill
 18689	for the support of the army they attached a "rider," or condition, to
 18690	the effect that no troops should be used to sustain the Republican
 18691	government in Louisiana. The Senate rejected the proposal. A deadlock
 18692	ensued and Congress adjourned without making provision for the army.
 18693	Satisfied with the technical victory, the Democrats let the army bill
 18694	pass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until
 18695	they wrung from President Hayes a measure forbidding the use of United
 18696	States troops in supervising elections. The following year they again
 18697	had recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting
 18698	an end to the use of money for military control of elections. The
 18699	reconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the Supreme
 18700	Court helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the
 18701	laws invalid. In 1878 the Democrats even won a majority in the Senate
 18702	and returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the
 18703	Confederate cause.
 18704	
 18705	The passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling. A new
 18706	generation of men was coming on the scene. The supremacy of the whites
 18707	in the South, if not yet complete, was at least assured. Federal
 18708	marshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed
 18709	authority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the
 18710	withdrawal of United States troops. The war on the remaining remnants of
 18711	the "force bills" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. When in 1894 the
 18712	last fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.
 18713	The only task that lay before the Southern leaders was to write in the
 18714	constitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which
 18715	would clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy
 18716	beyond the reach of outside intervention.
 18717	
 18718	=White Supremacy Sealed by New State Constitutions.=--The impetus to
 18719	this final step was given by the rise of the Populist movement in the
 18720	South, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw
 18721	the balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who
 18722	survived the process of intimidation. Southern leaders now devised new
 18723	constitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.
 18724	Mississippi took the lead in 1890; South Carolina followed five years
 18725	later; Louisiana, in 1898; North Carolina, in 1900; Alabama and
 18726	Maryland, in 1901; and Virginia, in 1902.
 18727	
 18728	The authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.
 18729	"The intelligent white men of the South," said Governor Tillman, "intend
 18730	to govern here." The fifteenth amendment to the federal Constitution,
 18731	however, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on
 18732	account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This made
 18733	necessary the devices of indirection. They were few, simple, and
 18734	effective. The first and most easily administered was the ingenious
 18735	provision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the
 18736	state constitution or "understand and explain it" when read to him by
 18737	the election officers. As an alternative, the payment of taxes or the
 18738	ownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification
 18739	for voting. Southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor
 18740	white men who had stood side by side with them "in the dark days of
 18741	reconstruction," also resorted to a famous provision known as "the
 18742	grandfather clause." This plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did
 18743	not have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had
 18744	voted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.
 18745	
 18746	The devices worked effectively. Of the 147,000 negroes in Mississippi
 18747	above the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the
 18748	constitution of 1890. Louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in
 18749	1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration
 18750	fell to 5300. An analysis of the figures for South Carolina in 1900
 18751	indicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of
 18752	that race took part in elections. Thus was closed this chapter of
 18753	reconstruction.
 18754	
 18755	=The Supreme Court Refuses to Intervene.=--Numerous efforts were made to
 18756	prevail upon the Supreme Court of the United States to declare such laws
 18757	unconstitutional; but the Court, usually on technical grounds, avoided
 18758	coming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. In one case
 18759	the Court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the
 18760	election machinery of Alabama; it concluded that "relief from a great
 18761	political wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the
 18762	state itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive
 18763	departments of the government of the United States." Only one of the
 18764	several schemes employed, namely, the "grandfather clause," was held to
 18765	be a violation of the federal Constitution. This blow, effected in 1915
 18766	by the decision in the Oklahoma and Maryland cases, left, however, the
 18767	main structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.
 18768	
 18769	=Proposals to Reduce Southern Representation in Congress.=--These
 18770	provisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,
 18771	in express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or
 18772	color. They did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the
 18773	fifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which
 18774	adopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. The
 18775	latter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult
 18776	male citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the
 18777	representation of the state in Congress shall be reduced in the
 18778	proportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the
 18779	whole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.
 18780	
 18781	Mindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement
 18782	in the South turned to the Republican party for relief, asking for
 18783	action by the political branches of the federal government as the
 18784	Supreme Court had suggested. The Republicans responded in their platform
 18785	of 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the
 18786	ballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in
 18787	letter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.
 18788	Though victorious in the election, the Republicans refrained from
 18789	reopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce Southern
 18790	representation in the House. Southern leaders, while protesting against
 18791	the declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle
 18792	threats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which
 18793	political reconstruction had been undone.
 18794	
 18795	=The Solid South.=--Out of the thirty-year conflict against "carpet-bag
 18796	rule" there emerged what was long known as the "solid South"--a South
 18797	that, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral
 18798	vote to a Republican candidate for President. Before the Civil War, the
 18799	Southern people had been divided on political questions. Take, for
 18800	example, the election of 1860. In all the fifteen slave states the
 18801	variety of opinion was marked. In nine of them--Delaware, Virginia,
 18802	Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and
 18803	Arkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme
 18804	Southern point of view, Breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. In
 18805	each of the six states which were carried by Breckinridge, there was a
 18806	large and powerful minority. In North Carolina Breckinridge's majority
 18807	over Bell and Douglas was only 849 votes. Equally astounding to those
 18808	who imagine the South united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the
 18809	vote for Bell, the Unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the
 18810	Constitution and silence on slavery. In every Southern state Bell's vote
 18811	was large. In Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee it was greater
 18812	than that received by Breckinridge; in Georgia, it was 42,000 against
 18813	51,000; in Louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in Mississippi, 25,000
 18814	against 40,000.
 18815	
 18816	The effect of the Civil War upon these divisions was immediate and
 18817	decisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to
 18818	adhere to the cause of Union. In the Confederacy itself nearly all
 18819	dissent was silenced by war. Men who had been bitter opponents joined
 18820	hands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they
 18821	remained side by side working against "Republican misrule and negro
 18822	domination." By 1890, after Northern supremacy was definitely broken,
 18823	they boasted that there were at least twelve Southern states in which no
 18824	Republican candidate for President could win a single electoral vote.
 18825	
 18826	=Dissent in the Solid South.=--Though every one grew accustomed to speak
 18827	of the South as "solid," it did not escape close observers that in a
 18828	number of Southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly
 18829	large body of dissenters. In 1892 the Populists made heavy inroads upon
 18830	the Democratic ranks. On other occasions, the contests between factions
 18831	within the Democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed
 18832	sharp differences of opinion. In some places, moreover, there grew up a
 18833	Republican minority of respectable size. For example, in Georgia, Mr.
 18834	Taft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for Mr. Bryan; in North
 18835	Carolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in Tennessee, 118,000 against
 18836	135,000; in Kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. In 1920, Senator Harding,
 18837	the Republican candidate, broke the record by carrying Tennessee as well
 18838	as Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Maryland.
 18839	
 18840	
 18841	THE ECONOMIC ADVANCE OF THE SOUTH
 18842	
 18843	=The Break-up of the Great Estates.=--In the dissolution of chattel
 18844	slavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before
 18845	the small farm. The plantation was in fact founded on slavery. It was
 18846	continued and expanded by slavery. Before the war the prosperous
 18847	planter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in
 18848	more land to add to his original domain. As his slaves increased in
 18849	number, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he
 18850	usually preferred the former, especially in the Far South. Still another
 18851	element favored the large estate. Slave labor quickly exhausted the soil
 18852	and of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the
 18853	extension of the area under cultivation. Finally, the planter took a
 18854	natural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his
 18855	social prestige.
 18856	
 18857	In 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. It was
 18858	difficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. The
 18859	planters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of
 18860	capital. Negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented
 18861	or bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white
 18862	supervision. The land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the
 18863	planting system, reasserted itself. Before these forces the plantation
 18864	broke up. The small farm became the unit of cultivation in the South as
 18865	in the North. Between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every
 18866	state south of the line of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, except in
 18867	Arkansas and Louisiana. From year to year the process of breaking up
 18868	continued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning
 18869	farmers.
 18870	
 18871	=The Diversification of Crops.=--No less significant was the concurrent
 18872	diversification of crops. Under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were
 18873	staples and "cotton was king." These were standard crops. The methods of
 18874	cultivation were simple and easily learned. They tested neither the
 18875	skill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. As the returns were quick, they
 18876	did not call for long-time investments of capital. After slavery was
 18877	abolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted
 18878	agriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. The mild
 18879	climate all the way around the coast from Virginia to Texas and the
 18880	character of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.
 18881	Peaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to
 18882	grow luxuriantly. Refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the
 18883	markets of great cities at the doors of Southern fruit and vegetable
 18884	gardeners. The South, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon
 18885	the Northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.
 18886	Between 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops
 18887	increased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.
 18888	
 18889	=The Industrial and Commercial Revolution.=--On top of the radical
 18890	changes in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. The
 18891	South had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had
 18892	been unfavorable to their development. Rivers that would have turned
 18893	millions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. Coal and iron beds
 18894	lay unopened. Timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for
 18895	planting, or fell to earth in decay. Southern enterprise was consumed in
 18896	planting. Slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied
 18897	the skilled labor for industry.

 18902	
 18903	After 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. As
 18904	soon as the paralysis of the war was over, the South caught the
 18905	industrial spirit that had conquered feudal Europe and the agricultural
 18906	North. In the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were
 18907	taken. Iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in
 18908	Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia,
 18909	Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas. Five important coal basins were uncovered:
 18910	in Virginia, North Carolina, the Appalachian chain from Maryland to
 18911	Northern Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas. Oil pools were found
 18912	in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the
 18913	output of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to
 18914	one hundred millions. The iron industries of West Virginia and Alabama
 18915	began to rival those of Pennsylvania. Birmingham became the Pittsburgh
 18916	and Atlanta the Chicago of the South.

 18919	
 18920	A SOUTHERN COTTON MILL IN A COTTON FIELD]
 18921	
 18922	In other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a
 18923	high rank. The development of Southern timber resources was in every
 18924	respect remarkable, particularly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and
 18925	Mississippi. At the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,
 18926	primacy in lumber had passed from the Great Lakes region to the South.
 18927	In 1913 eight Southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber
 18928	as the Lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of Washington
 18929	and Oregon.
 18930	
 18931	The development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly
 18932	astounding. In 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the
 18933	Southern states. In 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the
 18934	country. At the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two
 18935	Carolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their
 18936	entire cotton crop. Having both the raw materials and the power at hand,
 18937	they enjoyed many advantages over the New England rivals, and at the
 18938	opening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the
 18939	proportion of spindles annually put into operation. Moreover, the cotton
 18940	planters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look
 18941	forward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute
 18942	dependence upon the cotton exchanges of New York, New Orleans, and
 18943	Liverpool.
 18944	
 18945	Transportation kept pace with industry. In 1860, the South had about ten
 18946	thousand miles of railway. By 1880 the figure had doubled. During the
 18947	next twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the
 18948	increase being in Texas. About 1898 there opened a period of
 18949	consolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under
 18950	the leadership of Northern capitalists, and new through service opened
 18951	to the North and West. Thus Southern industries were given easy outlets
 18952	to the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of
 18953	national business enterprise.
 18954	
 18955	=The Social Effects of the Economic Changes.=--As long as the slave
 18956	system lasted and planting was the major interest, the South was bound
 18957	to be sectional in character. With slavery gone, crops diversified,
 18958	natural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order
 18959	of the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the South became more and
 18960	more assimilated to the system of the North. In this process several
 18961	lines of development are evident.
 18962	
 18963	In the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. Even in
 18964	the old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no
 18965	slaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under
 18966	severe handicaps. They found the fertile lands of the coast and river
 18967	valleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force
 18968	of circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the
 18969	crops were light. Still they increased in numbers and zealously worked
 18970	their freeholds.
 18971	
 18972	The war proved to be their opportunity. With the break-up of the
 18973	plantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. By
 18974	intelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore
 18975	much of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. In the meantime
 18976	they rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. It
 18977	became common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,
 18978	while their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.
 18979	Thus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the South.
 18980	Moreover the migration to the North and West, which had formerly carried
 18981	thousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,
 18982	was materially reduced. The energy of the agricultural population went
 18983	into rehabilitation.
 18984	
 18985	The increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the
 18986	rise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the
 18987	South. Before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches
 18988	of cotton and tobacco. The social affairs of the planter's family
 18989	centered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by
 18990	trips to distant cities or abroad. Carpentry, bricklaying, and
 18991	blacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.
 18992	Supplies were bought wholesale. In this way there was little place in
 18993	plantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and
 18994	mechanics.
 18995	
 18996	The abolition of slavery altered this. Small farms spread out where
 18997	plantations had once stood. The skilled freedmen turned to agriculture
 18998	rather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent
 18999	found an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. So local
 19000	merchants and mechanics became an important element in the social
 19001	system. In the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business
 19002	and professional men assumed the leadership.
 19003	
 19004	Another vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large
 19005	part of planting enterprise to business. Mr. Bruce, a Southern historian
 19006	of fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling
 19007	paragraph: "The higher planting class that under the old system gave so
 19008	much distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,
 19009	been concentrated in the cities. The families that in the time of
 19010	slavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a
 19011	few exceptions, in the towns. The transplantation has been practically
 19012	universal. The talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought
 19013	expression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts
 19014	of slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing
 19015	enterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. This was for
 19016	the ruling class of the South the natural outcome of the great economic
 19017	revolution that followed the war."
 19018	
 19019	As in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was
 19020	attended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent
 19021	not upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. When Jefferson
 19022	Davis was inaugurated President of the Southern Confederacy, there were
 19023	approximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in Southern
 19024	manufactures as against more than a million in Northern mills. Fifty
 19025	years later, Georgia and Alabama alone had more than one hundred and
 19026	fifty thousand wage-earners. Necessarily this meant also a material
 19027	increase in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton
 19028	spinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had
 19029	accompanied the rise of the textile industry in New England. In 1910,
 19030	New Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, and Houston stood in the same
 19031	relation to the New South that Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, and
 19032	Detroit had stood to the New West fifty years before. The problems of
 19033	labor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier
 19034	writers boasted would never perplex the planting South, had come in full
 19035	force.

 19039	A GLIMPSE OF MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE]
 19040	
 19041	=The Revolution in the Status of the Slaves.=--No part of Southern
 19042	society was so profoundly affected by the Civil War and economic
 19043	reconstruction as the former slaves. On the day of emancipation, they
 19044	stood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the
 19045	masters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help
 19046	that characterized the whites in general. They had never been accustomed
 19047	to looking out for themselves. The plantation bell had called them to
 19048	labor and released them. Doles of food and clothing had been regularly
 19049	made in given quantities. They did not understand wages, ownership,
 19050	renting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.
 19051	
 19052	When they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. They could
 19053	flee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant
 19054	North, to seek a livelihood. Thousands of them chose this way,
 19055	overcrowding cities where disease mowed them down. They could remain
 19056	where they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of
 19057	food, clothing, and shelter. This second course the major portion of
 19058	them chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation
 19059	was much like the old, in fact. It was still one of barter. The planter
 19060	offered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor
 19061	in return. That was the best that many of them could do.
 19062	
 19063	A third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former
 19064	master, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. This
 19065	way a large number of them chose. It offered them a chance to become
 19066	land owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to
 19067	a certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. The final
 19068	and most difficult path was that to ownership of land. Many a master
 19069	helped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy
 19070	terms. The more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as
 19071	renters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many
 19072	cases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers
 19073	on the land owned the soil they tilled.
 19074	
 19075	In the meantime, the South, though relatively poor, made relatively
 19076	large expenditures for the education of the colored population. By the
 19077	opening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than
 19078	one-half of the colored children of school age. While in many respects
 19079	this progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,
 19080	must be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which
 19081	prevailed under slavery.
 19082	
 19083	In spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the
 19084	South continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the
 19085	country. They were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the
 19086	suffrage, especially in the Far South. Special rooms were set aside for
 19087	them at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. In
 19088	the field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the
 19089	census figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition
 19090	which their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and
 19091	in labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of
 19092	aptitude. Whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the
 19093	opening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators
 19094	nor the fears of their opponents were realized. The marks of the
 19095	"peculiar institution" were still largely impressed upon Southern
 19096	society.
 19097	
 19098	The situation, however, was by no means unchanging. On the contrary
 19099	there was a decided drift in affairs. For one thing, the proportion of
 19100	negroes in the South had slowly declined. By 1900 they were in a
 19101	majority in only two states, South Carolina and Mississippi. In
 19102	Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina the proportion of
 19103	the white population was steadily growing. The colored migration
 19104	northward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which
 19105	characterized pioneer days declined. At the same time a part of the
 19106	foreign immigration into the United States was diverted southward. As
 19107	the years passed these tendencies gained momentum. The already huge
 19108	colored quarters in some Northern cities were widely expanded, as whole
 19109	counties in the South were stripped of their colored laborers. The race
 19110	question, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less
 19111	sectional, more and more national. The South was drawn into the main
 19112	stream of national life. The separatist forces which produced the
 19113	cataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.

 19217	BUSINESS ENTERPRISE AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
 19218	
 19219	
 19220	If a single phrase be chosen to characterize American life during the
 19221	generation that followed the age of Douglas and Lincoln, it must be
 19222	"business enterprise"--the tremendous, irresistible energy of a virile
 19223	people, mounting in numbers toward a hundred million and applied without
 19224	let or hindrance to the developing of natural resources of unparalleled
 19225	richness. The chief goal of this effort was high profits for the
 19226	captains of industry, on the one hand; and high wages for the workers,
 19227	on the other. Its signs, to use the language of a Republican orator in
 19228	1876, were golden harvest fields, whirling spindles, turning wheels,
 19229	open furnace doors, flaming forges, and chimneys filled with eager fire.
 19230	The device blazoned on its shield and written over its factory doors was
 19231	"prosperity." A Republican President was its "advance agent." Released
 19232	from the hampering interference of the Southern planters and the
 19233	confusing issues of the slavery controversy, business enterprise sprang
 19234	forward to the task of winning the entire country. Then it flung its
 19235	outposts to the uttermost parts of the earth--Europe, Africa, and the
 19236	Orient--where were to be found markets for American goods and natural
 19237	resources for American capital to develop.
 19238	
 19239	
 19240	RAILWAYS AND INDUSTRY
 19241	
 19242	=The Outward Signs of Enterprise.=--It is difficult to comprehend all
 19243	the multitudinous activities of American business energy or to appraise
 19244	its effects upon the life and destiny of the American people; for beyond
 19245	the horizon of the twentieth century lie consequences as yet undreamed
 19246	of in our poor philosophy. Statisticians attempt to record its
 19247	achievements in terms of miles of railways built, factories opened, men
 19248	and women employed, fortunes made, wages paid, cities founded, rivers
 19249	spanned, boxes, bales, and tons produced. Historians apply standards of
 19250	comparison with the past. Against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,
 19251	they set the swift express, rushing from New York to San Francisco in
 19252	less time than Washington consumed in his triumphal tour from Mt. Vernon
 19253	to New York for his first inaugural. Against the lazy sailing vessel
 19254	drifting before a genial breeze, they place the turbine steamer crossing
 19255	the Atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane, in fifteen
 19256	hours. For the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and
 19257	apprentices wrought by hand, they offer the giant factory where ten
 19258	thousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam. They write
 19259	of the "romance of invention" and the "captains of industry."

 19264	
 19265	=The Service of the Railway.=--All this is fitting in its way. Figures
 19266	and contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. Take, for example,
 19267	the extension of railways. It is easy to relate that there were 30,000
 19268	miles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. It is easy to show
 19269	upon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely
 19270	knitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few
 19271	roads ending in the Mississippi Valley in 1860 were extended and
 19272	multiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond
 19273	the valley. All this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not
 19274	reveal the significance of railways for American life. It does not
 19275	indicate how railways made a continental market for American goods; nor
 19276	how they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the
 19277	advancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old East; nor
 19278	how they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet
 19279	how in the West they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of
 19280	homesteads, the builders of states.
 19281	
 19282	=Government Aid for Railways.=--Still the story is not ended. The
 19283	significant relation between railways and politics must not be
 19284	overlooked. The bounty of a lavish government, for example, made
 19285	possible the work of railway promoters. By the year 1872 the Federal
 19286	government had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an
 19287	area estimated as almost equal to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut,
 19288	Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The
 19289	Union Pacific Company alone secured from the federal government a free
 19290	right of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with
 19291	each mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured
 19292	by a second mortgage on the company's property. More than half of the
 19293	northern tier of states lying against Canada from Lake Michigan to the
 19294	Pacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon
 19295	roads. About half of New Mexico, Arizona, and California was also given
 19296	outright to railway companies. These vast grants from the federal
 19297	government were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by
 19298	subscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. The
 19299	history of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that
 19300	engineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.
 19301	
 19302	=Railway Fortunes and Capital.=--Out of this gigantic railway promotion,
 19303	the first really immense American fortunes were made. Henry Adams, the
 19304	grandson of John Quincy Adams, related that his grandfather on his
 19305	mother's side, Peter Brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two
 19306	million dollars, "supposed to be the largest estate in Boston," then one
 19307	of the few centers of great riches. Compared with the opulence that
 19308	sprang out of the Union Pacific, the Northern Pacific, the Southern
 19309	Pacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of Peter
 19310	Brooks was a poor man's heritage.
 19311	
 19312	The capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the
 19313	imagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. The total debt of
 19314	the United States incurred in the Revolutionary War--a debt which those
 19315	of little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a
 19316	figure well under $75,000,000. When the Union Pacific Railroad was
 19317	completed, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first
 19318	mortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the
 19319	government, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant
 19320	bonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in
 19321	stock--making $110,000,000 in all. If the amount due the United States
 19322	government be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks
 19323	and bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of Hamilton's
 19324	day--a debt that strained all the resources of the Federal government in
 19325	1790. Such was the financial significance of the railways.
 19326	
 19327	[Illustration: RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1918]
 19328	
 19329	=Growth and Extension of Industry.=--In the field of manufacturing,
 19330	mining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far
 19331	outstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway
 19332	construction. By the end of the century there were about ten billion
 19333	dollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners
 19334	employed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion
 19335	dollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. In the Eastern states
 19336	industries multiplied. In the Northwest territory, the old home of
 19337	Jacksonian Democracy, they overtopped agriculture. By the end of the
 19338	century, Ohio had almost reached and Illinois had surpassed
 19339	Massachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.
 19340	
 19341	That was not all. Untold wealth in the form of natural resources was
 19342	discovered in the South and West. Coal deposits were found in the
 19343	Appalachians stretching from Pennsylvania down to Alabama, in Michigan,
 19344	in the Mississippi Valley, and in the Western mountains from North
 19345	Dakota to New Mexico. In nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also
 19346	discovered and the great fields of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota
 19347	soon rivaled those of the Appalachian area. Copper, lead, gold, and
 19348	silver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors
 19349	who left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. Petroleum, first
 19350	pumped from the wells of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new
 19351	fortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. It
 19352	scattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through Oklahoma,
 19353	Texas, and California.
 19354	
 19355	=The Trust--an Instrument of Industrial Progress.=--Business enterprise,
 19356	under the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small
 19357	groups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had
 19358	not advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier
 19359	leaders of even greater imagination. New constructive genius now brought
 19360	together and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or
 19361	thousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of
 19362	cooperation on a national scale. Price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin
 19363	to those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of
 19364	companies in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia to unite in
 19365	price-fixing. Three years later a group of oil interests formed a close
 19366	organization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among
 19367	whom was John D. Rockefeller. The trustees, in turn, issued
 19368	certificates representing the share to which each participant was
 19369	entitled; and took over the management of the entire business. Such was
 19370	the nature of the "trust," which was to play such an unique role in the
 19371	progress of America.
 19372	
 19373	The idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,
 19374	lead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field
 19375	there loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of
 19376	the output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices
 19377	charged to consumers. With the passing years, the railways, mills,
 19378	mines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual
 19379	owners to corporations. At the end of the nineteenth century, the whole
 19380	face of American business was changed. Three-fourths of the output from
 19381	industries came from factories under corporate management and only
 19382	one-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.
 19383	
 19384	[Illustration: JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER]
 19385	
 19386	=The Banking Corporation.=--Very closely related to the growth of
 19387	business enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. In the
 19388	old days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his
 19389	own undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they
 19390	set no industry in motion. Even in the early stages of modern business,
 19391	it was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by
 19392	financing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. This state of
 19393	affairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations
 19394	requiring millions and even billions of capital. The banks, once an
 19395	adjunct to business, became the leaders in business.
 19396	
 19397	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
 19398	
 19399	WALL STREET, NEW YORK CITY]
 19400	
 19401	It was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by
 19402	new corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on
 19403	their operations. Indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in
 19404	business were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions
 19405	and billions under their control. Through their connections with one
 19406	another, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the
 19407	pennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich
 19408	and pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.
 19409	In this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a
 19410	few great centers, like Wall Street in New York or State Street in
 19411	Boston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the
 19412	savings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old
 19413	corporations.
 19414	
 19415	=The Significance of the Corporation.=--The corporation, in fact, became
 19416	the striking feature of American business life, one of the most
 19417	marvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and
 19418	the number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. The effect
 19419	of its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special
 19420	facts are obvious. It made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely
 19421	beyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. It eliminated
 19422	many of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with
 19423	manufacture, advertising, and selling. It studied the cheapest methods
 19424	of production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or
 19425	disadvantageously located. It established laboratories for research in
 19426	industry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. Through the sale of
 19427	stocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become
 19428	capitalists, if only in a small way. The corporation made it possible
 19429	for one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar
 19430	business concern--a thing entirely impossible under a regime of
 19431	individual owners and partnerships.
 19432	
 19433	There was, of course, another side to the picture. Many of the
 19434	corporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by
 19435	economies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.
 19436	Sometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their
 19437	competitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,
 19438	and contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. Wherever
 19439	a trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion
 19440	over the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade
 19441	unions. In short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,
 19442	in politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.
 19443	
 19444	=The Corporation and Labor.=--In the development of the corporation
 19445	there was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between
 19446	master and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. For
 19447	the personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a
 19448	new relation. "In most parts of our country," as President Wilson once
 19449	said, "men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in
 19450	which they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or
 19451	lower grade--of great corporations." The owner disappeared from the
 19452	factory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually
 19453	invisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to
 19454	make profits for the owners. Hence the term "soulless corporation,"
 19455	which was to exert such a deep influence on American thinking about
 19456	industrial relations.
 19457	
 19458	=Cities and Immigration.=--Expressed in terms of human life, this era of
 19459	unprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense
 19460	labor supply, derived mainly from European immigration. Here, too,
 19461	figures tell only a part of the story. In Washington's day nine-tenths
 19462	of the American people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the
 19463	country; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of
 19464	2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns
 19465	of over 2500. In forty years, between 1860 and 1900, Greater New York
 19466	had grown from 1,174,000 to 3,437,000; San Francisco from 56,000 to
 19467	342,000; Chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. The miles of city tenements
 19468	began to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of
 19469	the West. The time so dreaded by Jefferson had arrived. People were
 19470	"piled upon one another in great cities" and the republic of small
 19471	farmers had passed away.
 19472	
 19473	To these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of
 19474	immigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to
 19475	three-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million
 19476	mark in a single year at the opening of the new century. Immigration was
 19477	as old as America but new elements now entered the situation. In the
 19478	first place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the
 19479	newcomers. The migration from Northern Europe--England, Ireland,
 19480	Germany, and Scandinavia--diminished; that from Italy, Russia, and
 19481	Austria-Hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number
 19482	coming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. These
 19483	later immigrants were Italians, Poles, Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks,
 19484	Russians, and Jews, who came from countries far removed from the
 19485	language and the traditions of England whence came the founders of
 19486	America.
 19487	
 19488	In the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from
 19489	that given to the immigrants in the early days. By 1890 all the free
 19490	land was gone. They could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the
 19491	native Americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and
 19492	ideas of American life. On the contrary, they were diverted mainly to
 19493	the industrial centers. There they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into
 19494	colonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their
 19495	newspapers, and their old-world customs and views.
 19496	
 19497	So eager were American business men to get an enormous labor supply that
 19498	they asked few questions about the effect of this "alien invasion" upon
 19499	the old America inherited from the fathers. They even stimulated the
 19500	invasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under
 19501	contract to work in specified mines and mills. There seemed to be no
 19502	limit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be
 19503	built, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a
 19504	continent. As for the future, that was in the hands of Providence!
 19505	
 19506	=Business Theories of Politics.=--As the statesmen of Hamilton's school
 19507	and the planters of Calhoun's had their theories of government and
 19508	politics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. It was
 19509	simple and easily stated. "It is the duty of the government," they
 19510	urged, "to protect American industry against foreign competition by
 19511	means of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous
 19512	grants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to
 19513	energetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the
 19514	initiative and drive of individuals and companies." All government
 19515	interference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of
 19516	private business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably
 19517	impertinent. Judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived
 19518	the nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor
 19519	unions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a
 19520	government whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and
 19521	protect industry against the foreign manufacturer. Such was the
 19522	political theory of business during the generation that followed the
 19523	Civil War.
 19524	
 19525	
 19526	THE SUPREMACY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (1861-85)
 19527	
 19528	=Business Men and Republican Policies.=--Most of the leaders in industry
 19529	gravitated to the Republican ranks. They worked in the North and the
 19530	Republican party was essentially Northern. It was moreover--at least so
 19531	far as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to
 19532	protective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion
 19533	of railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal
 19534	improvements. It was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. It
 19535	proclaimed America to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries
 19536	and flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man
 19537	the mines, and settle upon Western lands. In a word the Republicans
 19538	stood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and
 19539	prosperity of business. At the same time they resisted government
 19540	interference with private enterprise. They did not regulate railway
 19541	rates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway
 19542	companies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. To
 19543	sum it up, the political theories of the Republican party for three
 19544	decades after the Civil War were the theories of American
 19545	business--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and "the
 19546	full dinner pail" for the workmen. Naturally a large portion of those
 19547	who flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for
 19548	its candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.
 19549	
 19550	=Sources of Republican Strength in the North.=--The Republican party was
 19551	in fact a political organization of singular power. It originated in a
 19552	wave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the
 19553	abolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like James Russell Lowell
 19554	and George William Curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was
 19555	neither safe nor popular. To moral principles it added practical
 19556	considerations. Business men had confidence in it. Workingmen, who
 19557	longed for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land
 19558	policy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the West. The
 19559	immigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same
 19560	beneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate
 19561	as large as many a baronial domain in the Old World. Under a Republican
 19562	administration, the union had been saved. To it the veterans of the war
 19563	could turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the
 19564	government could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that
 19565	the world had ever seen. Under a Republican administration also the
 19566	great debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the
 19567	Republican party every investor in government bonds could look for the
 19568	full and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. The spoils
 19569	system, inaugurated by Jacksonian Democracy, in turn placed all the
 19570	federal offices in Republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers
 19571	to be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.
 19572	
 19573	Of all these things Republican leaders made full and vigorous use,
 19574	sometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political
 19575	usage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. Particularly was this
 19576	true in the case of saving the union. "When in the economy of
 19577	Providence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the
 19578	Republican party came into power," ran a declaration in one platform.
 19579	"The Republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four
 19580	million slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established
 19581	universal suffrage," ran another. As for the aid rendered by the
 19582	millions of Northern Democrats who stood by the union and the tens of
 19583	thousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the Republicans
 19584	in their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. They repeatedly charged the
 19585	Democratic party "with being the same in character and spirit as when it
 19586	sympathized with treason."
 19587	
 19588	=Republican Control of the South.=--To the strength enjoyed in the
 19589	North, the Republicans for a long time added the advantages that came
 19590	from control over the former Confederate states where the newly
 19591	enfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to
 19592	the party responsible for their freedom. In this branch of politics,
 19593	motives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at
 19594	their proper values. On the one side of the ledger must be set the
 19595	vigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to
 19596	win for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only
 19597	slavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. On the same side
 19598	must be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and
 19599	field to save the union and who regarded continued Republican supremacy
 19600	after the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in
 19601	secession from coming back to power. At the same time there were
 19602	undoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game
 19603	and who made use of "carpet-bagging" in the South to win the spoils that
 19604	might result from it. At all events, both by laws and presidential acts,
 19605	the Republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of
 19606	their dominion in the South. Their declaration that neither the law nor
 19607	its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of
 19608	citizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude
 19609	appealed to idealists and brought results in elections. Even South
 19610	Carolina, where reposed the ashes of John C. Calhoun, went Republican in
 19611	1872 by a vote of three to one!
 19612	
 19613	Republican control was made easy by the force bills described in a
 19614	previous chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in
 19615	federal officers appointed by Republican Presidents. These drastic
 19616	measures, departing from American tradition, the Republican authors
 19617	urged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely
 19618	in the South where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from
 19619	using it; but also in the North, particularly in New York City, where it
 19620	was claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by Democratic leaders.
 19621	
 19622	The Democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying
 19623	that the force bills were nothing but devices created by the Republicans
 19624	for the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic
 19625	interference with elections. Even the measures of reconstruction were
 19626	deemed by Democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish
 19627	Republican power throughout the country. "Nor is there the slightest
 19628	doubt," exclaimed Samuel J. Tilden, spokesman of the Democrats in New
 19629	York and candidate for President in 1876, "that the paramount object and
 19630	motive of the Republican party is by these means to secure itself
 19631	against a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous
 19632	Northern commonwealths.... When the Republican party resolved to
 19633	establish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself
 19634	the representation of those states in Congress, it had to begin by
 19635	governing the people of those states by the sword.... The next was the
 19636	creation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by
 19637	exclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over
 19638	registration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every
 19639	form of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over
 19640	four and a half million whites."
 19641	
 19642	=The War as a Campaign Issue.=--Even the repeal of force bills could not
 19643	allay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. The Republicans
 19644	could not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the
 19645	union and insisted on calling them "traitors" and "rebels." The
 19646	Southerners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the
 19647	Republicans only as political oppressors. The passions of the war had
 19648	been too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. The
 19649	generation that went through it all remembered it all. For twenty
 19650	years, the Republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made "a
 19651	straight appeal to the patriotism of the Northern voters." They
 19652	maintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated
 19653	the slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the
 19654	freedmen.
 19655	
 19656	Though the Democrats, especially in the North, resented this policy and
 19657	dubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, "waving the bloody
 19658	shirt," the Republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a
 19659	ready popular appeal. As late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that
 19660	they might "wring one more President from the bloody shirt." They
 19661	refused to let the country forget that the Democratic candidate, Grover
 19662	Cleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they
 19663	made political capital out of the fact that he had "insulted the
 19664	veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic" by going fishing on
 19665	Decoration Day.
 19666	
 19667	=Three Republican Presidents.=--Fortified by all these elements of
 19668	strength, the Republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. The
 19669	three Presidents elected in this period, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield, had
 19670	certain striking characteristics in common. They were all of origin
 19671	humble enough to please the most exacting Jacksonian Democrat. They had
 19672	been generals in the union army. Grant, next to Lincoln, was regarded as
 19673	the savior of the Constitution. Hayes and Garfield, though lesser lights
 19674	in the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by
 19675	veterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the Grand Army of the
 19676	Republic. It is true that Grant was not a politician and had never voted
 19677	the Republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. Hayes and
 19678	Garfield on the other hand were loyal party men. The former had served
 19679	in Congress and for three terms as governor of his state. The latter had
 19680	long been a member of the House of Representatives and was Senator-elect
 19681	when he received the nomination for President.
 19682	
 19683	All of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not
 19684	forgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. All
 19685	of them were from Ohio--though Grant had been in Illinois when the
 19686	summons to military duties came--and Ohio was a strategic state. It lay
 19687	between the manufacturing East and the agrarian country to the West.
 19688	Having growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the
 19689	protective tariff. Yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not
 19690	
 19691	without sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade
 19692	tendencies. Whatever share the East had in shaping laws and framing
 19693	policies, it was clear that the West was to have the candidates. This
 19694	division in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always
 19695	accompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for Vice
 19696	President. With Garfield, for example, was associated a prominent New
 19697	York politician, Chester A. Arthur, who, as fate decreed, was destined
 19698	to more than three years' service as chief magistrate, on the
 19699	assassination of his superior in office.
 19700	
 19701	=The Disputed Election of 1876.=--While taking note of the long years of
 19702	Republican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the
 19703	minds of many historians as to whether one of the three Presidents,
 19704	Hayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. His Democratic opponent,
 19705	Samuel J. Tilden, received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million
 19706	and had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. At all
 19707	events, four states sent in double returns, one set for Tilden and
 19708	another for Hayes; and a deadlock ensued. Both parties vehemently
 19709	claimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not
 19710	shrink from speaking of civil war again. Fortunately, in the end, the
 19711	counsels of peace prevailed. Congress provided for an electoral
 19712	commission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. The
 19713	Democrats, inspired by Tilden's moderation, accepted the judgment in
 19714	favor of Hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really
 19715	entitled to the office.
 19716	
 19717	
 19718	THE GROWTH OF OPPOSITION TO REPUBLICAN RULE
 19719	
 19720	=Abuses in American Political Life.=--During their long tenure of
 19721	office, the Republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of
 19722	power; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some
 19723	who found shelter within the party. For that matter neither did the
 19724	Democrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities
 19725	where they had the majority. In New York City, for instance, the local
 19726	Democratic organization, known as Tammany Hall, passed under the sway of
 19727	a group of politicians headed by "Boss" Tweed. He plundered the city
 19728	treasury until public-spirited citizens, supported by Samuel J. Tilden,
 19729	the Democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader
 19730	from power, and sent him to jail. In Philadelphia, the local Republican
 19731	bosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by New York
 19732	politicians. Indeed, the decade that followed the Civil War was marred
 19733	by so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to
 19734	inquire: "Are not all the great communities of the Western World growing
 19735	more corrupt as they grow in wealth?"
 19736	
 19737	In the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were
 19738	greater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. One
 19739	revelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with
 19740	the spirit of peculation. Members of Congress, it was found, accepted
 19741	railway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other
 19742	concessions to the companies. In the administration as well as the
 19743	legislature the disease was rife. Revenue officers permitted whisky
 19744	distillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return. A
 19745	probe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous "star
 19746	route frauds"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose
 19747	lines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. Even
 19748	cabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent
 19749	led straight to the door of one of them.
 19750	
 19751	In the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more
 19752	virulent as the number of federal employees increased. The holders of
 19753	offices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political
 19754	army. They crowded into Republican councils, for the Republicans, being
 19755	in power, could alone dispense federal favors. They filled positions in
 19756	the party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national
 19757	convention. They helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and
 19758	elbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party
 19759	intrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.
 19760	Even the Civil Service Act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant Congress two
 19761	years after the assassination of Garfield, made little change for a long
 19762	time. It took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government
 19763	positions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party
 19764	workers from the public treasury.
 19765	
 19766	On viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became
 19767	profoundly discouraged. James Russell Lowell, for example, thought he
 19768	saw a steady decline in public morals. In 1865, hearing of Lee's
 19769	surrender, he had exclaimed: "There is something magnificent in having a
 19770	country to love!" Ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the
 19771	centennial at Philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting
 19772	satire on the nation:
 19773	
 19774	    "Show your state legislatures; show your Rings;
 19775	     And challenge Europe to produce such things
 19776	     As high officials sitting half in sight
 19777	     To share the plunder and fix things right.
 19778	     If that don't fetch her, why, you need only
 19779	     To show your latest style in martyrs,--Tweed:
 19780	     She'll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears
 19781	     At such advance in one poor hundred years."
 19782	
 19783	When his critics condemned him for this "attack upon his native land,"
 19784	Lowell replied in sadness: "These fellows have no notion of what love of
 19785	country means. It was in my very blood and bones. If I am not an
 19786	American who ever was?... What fills me with doubt and dismay is the
 19787	degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of democracy?
 19788	Is ours a 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' or
 19789	a Kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of
 19790	knaves at the cost of fools?"
 19791	
 19792	=The Reform Movement in Republican Ranks.=--The sentiments expressed by
 19793	Lowell, himself a Republican and for a time American ambassador to
 19794	England, were shared by many men in his party. Very soon after the close
 19795	of the Civil War some of them began to protest vigorously against the
 19796	policies and conduct of their leaders. In 1872, the dissenters, calling
 19797	themselves Liberal Republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a
 19798	candidate of their own, Horace Greeley, and put forward a platform
 19799	indicting the Republican President fiercely enough to please the most
 19800	uncompromising Democrat. They accused Grant of using "the powers and
 19801	opportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends."
 19802	They charged him with retaining "notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in
 19803	places of power and responsibility." They alleged that the Republican
 19804	party kept "alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to
 19805	use them for their own advantages," and employed the "public service of
 19806	the government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence."
 19807	
 19808	It was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any
 19809	considerable number of Republicans accepted the views of the Liberals.
 19810	Greeley, though indorsed by the Democrats, was utterly routed and died
 19811	of a broken heart. The lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that
 19812	independent action was futile. So, at least, it was regarded by most men
 19813	of the rising generation like Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, and
 19814	Theodore Roosevelt, of New York. Profiting by the experience of Greeley
 19815	they insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the
 19816	party of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work "on the
 19817	inside."
 19818	
 19819	=The Mugwumps and Cleveland Democracy in 1884.=--Though aided by
 19820	Republican dissensions, the Democrats were slow in making headway
 19821	against the political current. They were deprived of the energetic and
 19822	capable leadership once afforded by the planters, like Calhoun, Davis,
 19823	and Toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for
 19824	secession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate
 19825	South. Not until the last Southern state was restored to the union, not
 19826	until a general amnesty was wrung from Congress, not until white
 19827	supremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier
 19828	withdrawn from Southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the
 19829	presidency.
 19830	
 19831	The opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of
 19832	circumstances favored their aspirations. The Republicans, leaving the
 19833	Ohio Valley in their search for a candidate, nominated James G. Blaine
 19834	of Maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the
 19835	reformers in his own party. The Democrats on their side were able to
 19836	find at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in
 19837	the sphere of national politics, Grover Cleveland, then governor of New
 19838	York and widely celebrated as a man of "sterling honesty." At the same
 19839	time a number of dissatisfied Republicans openly espoused the Democratic
 19840	cause,--among them Carl Schurz, George William Curtis, Henry Ward
 19841	Beecher, and William Everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted
 19842	integrity. Though the "regular" Republicans called them "Mugwumps" and
 19843	laughed at them as the "men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet
 19844	knights of politics," they had a following that was not to be despised.
 19845	
 19846	The campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in
 19847	American history. Issues were thrust into the background. The tariff,
 19848	though mentioned, was not taken seriously. Abuse of the opposition was
 19849	the favorite resource of party orators. The Democrats insisted that "the
 19850	Republican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. In
 19851	practice it is an organization for enriching those who control its
 19852	machinery." For the Republican candidate, Blaine, they could hardly find
 19853	words to express their contempt. The Republicans retaliated in kind.
 19854	They praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and
 19855	denounced the "fraud and violence practiced by the Democracy in the
 19856	Southern states." Seeing little objectionable in the public record of
 19857	Cleveland as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, they attacked
 19858	his personal character. Perhaps never in the history of political
 19859	campaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to
 19860	so low a level. Decent people were sickened. Even hot partisans shrank
 19861	from their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect
 19862	on their heedless passions. Moreover, nothing was decided by the
 19863	balloting. Cleveland was elected, but his victory was a narrow one. A
 19864	change of a few hundred votes in New York would have sent his opponent
 19865	to the White House instead.
 19866	
 19867	=Changing Political Fortunes (1888-96).=--After the Democrats had
 19868	settled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, President
 19869	Cleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as "vicious,
 19870	inequitable, and illogical"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden
 19871	upon "every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers."
 19872	Business enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. The Republicans
 19873	characterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the
 19874	industries of the country. Mainly on that issue they elected in 1888
 19875	Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a
 19876	descendant of the hero of Tippecanoe, and a son of the old Northwest.
 19877	Accepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their
 19878	principles, the Republicans, under the leadership of William McKinley in
 19879	the House of Representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the
 19880	highest duties yet laid in our history. To their utter surprise,
 19881	however, they were instantly informed by the country that their program
 19882	was not approved. That very autumn they lost in the congressional
 19883	elections, and two years later they were decisively beaten in the
 19884	presidential campaign, Cleveland once more leading his party to victory.

 20001	THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT WEST
 20002	
 20003	
 20004	At the close of the Civil War, Kansas and Texas were sentinel states on
 20005	the middle border. Beyond the Rockies, California, Oregon, and Nevada
 20006	stood guard, the last of them having been just admitted to furnish
 20007	another vote for the fifteenth amendment abolishing slavery. Between the
 20008	near and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain, desert, plateau, and
 20009	mountain, almost wholly undeveloped. A broad domain, extending from
 20010	Canada to Mexico, and embracing the regions now included in Washington,
 20011	Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the Dakotas, and
 20012	Oklahoma, had fewer than half a million inhabitants. It was laid out
 20013	into territories, each administered under a governor appointed by the
 20014	President and Senate and, as soon as there was the requisite number of
 20015	inhabitants, a legislature elected by the voters. No railway line
 20016	stretched across the desert. St. Joseph on the Missouri was the terminus
 20017	of the Eastern lines. It required twenty-five days for a passenger to
 20018	make the overland journey to California by the stagecoach system,
 20019	established in 1858, and more than ten days for the swift pony express,
 20020	organized in 1860, to carry a letter to San Francisco. Indians still
 20021	roamed the plain and desert and more than one powerful tribe disputed
 20022	the white man's title to the soil.
 20023	
 20024	
 20025	THE RAILWAYS AS TRAIL BLAZERS
 20026	
 20027	=Opening Railways to the Pacific.=--A decade before the Civil War the
 20028	importance of rail connection between the East and the Pacific Coast had
 20029	been recognized. Pressure had already been brought to bear on Congress
 20030	to authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in
 20031	its aid. Both the Democrats and Republicans approved the idea, but it
 20032	was involved in the slavery controversy. Indeed it was submerged in it.
 20033	Southern statesmen wanted connections between the Gulf and the Pacific
 20034	through Texas, while Northerners stood out for a central route.
 20035	
 20036	The North had its way during the war. Congress, by legislation initiated
 20037	in 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a
 20038	line from the Missouri River to California and made grants of land and
 20039	loans of money to aid in the enterprise. The Western end, the Central
 20040	Pacific, was laid out under the supervision of Leland Stanford. It was
 20041	heavily financed by the Mormons of Utah and also by the state
 20042	government, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of California; and it
 20043	was built principally by Chinese labor. The Eastern end, the Union
 20044	Pacific, starting at Omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the
 20045	Civil War and immigrants from Ireland and Germany. In 1869 the two
 20046	companies met near Ogden in Utah and the driving of the last spike,
 20047	uniting the Atlantic and the Pacific, was the occasion of a great
 20048	demonstration.
 20049	
 20050	Other lines to the Pacific were projected at the same time; but the
 20051	panic of 1873 checked railway enterprise for a while. With the revival
 20052	of prosperity at the end of that decade, construction was renewed with
 20053	vigor and the year 1883 marked a series of railway triumphs. In February
 20054	trains were running from New Orleans through Houston, San Antonio, and
 20055	Yuma to San Francisco, as a result of a union of the Texas Pacific with
 20056	the Southern Pacific and its subsidiary corporations. In September the
 20057	last spike was driven in the Northern Pacific at Helena, Montana. Lake
 20058	Superior was connected with Puget Sound. The waters explored by Joliet
 20059	and Marquette were joined to the waters plowed by Sir Francis Drake
 20060	while he was searching for a route around the world. That same year also
 20061	a third line was opened to the Pacific by way of the Atchison, Topeka
 20062	and Santa Fe, making connections through Albuquerque and Needles with
 20063	San Francisco. The fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be
 20064	realized.
 20065	
 20066	[Illustration: UNITED STATES IN 1870]
 20067	
 20068	=Western Railways Precede Settlement.=--In the Old World and on our
 20069	Atlantic seaboard, railways followed population and markets. In the Far
 20070	West, railways usually preceded the people. Railway builders planned
 20071	cities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them. They sent
 20072	missionaries to spread the gospel of "Western opportunity" to people in
 20073	the Middle West, in the Eastern cities, and in Southern states. Then
 20074	they carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains
 20075	to the distant Dakotas and still farther afield. So the development of
 20076	the Far West was not left to the tedious processes of time. It was
 20077	pushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of
 20078	money-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the
 20079	past.
 20080	
 20081	These empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more
 20082	from the government; they overcame every obstacle of canon, mountain,
 20083	and stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the
 20084	plans made by the engineers. Having the towns ready and railway and
 20085	steamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried
 20086	out the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the
 20087	land. It was in this way that "the frontier speculator paved the way for
 20088	the frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could
 20089	farm." The spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out
 20090	railways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement
 20091	of that day: "This extension will run 42 miles from York, northeast
 20092	through the Island Lake country, and will have five good North Dakota
 20093	towns. The stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and
 20094	will be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the
 20095	grain season. Prospective merchants have been active in securing
 20096	desirable locations at the different towns on the line. There are still
 20097	opportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and
 20098	drug stores, etc."
 20099	
 20100	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
 20101	
 20102	A TOWN ON THE PRAIRIE]
 20103	
 20104	Among the railway promoters and builders in the West, James J. Hill,
 20105	of the Great Northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful
 20106	figures. He knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers
 20107	and freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. He
 20108	therefore organized publicity in the Virginias, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana,
 20109	Illinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska especially. He sent out agents to tell
 20110	the story of Western opportunity in this vein: "You see your children
 20111	come out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the
 20112	cost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can't
 20113	afford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. They have
 20114	to go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or
 20115	hire out as farm hands. There is no future for them there. If you are
 20116	doing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children
 20117	and see them prosper around you, don't leave here. But if you want
 20118	independence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is
 20119	carrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can
 20120	do no worse by moving.... You farmers talk of free trade and protection
 20121	and what this or that political party will do for you. Why don't you
 20122	vote a homestead for yourself? That is the only thing Uncle Sam will
 20123	ever give you. Jim Hill hasn't an acre of land to sell you. We are not
 20124	in the real estate business. We don't want you to go out West and make a
 20125	failure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make
 20126	the first transaction a loss.... We must have landless men for a manless
 20127	land."
 20128	
 20129	Unlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,
 20130	Hill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and
 20131	use the railways as the means of exchange. Consequently he fixed low
 20132	rates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and
 20133	household furniture free. By doing this he made an appeal that was
 20134	answered by eager families. In 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left
 20135	Indiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and
 20136	children, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods
 20137	and live stock. In the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the
 20138	Middle West and the South, responding to his call, went to the Western
 20139	country where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under
 20140	cultivation.
 20141	
 20142	When Hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything
 20143	that increased the productivity of their labor. Was the output of food
 20144	for his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? Hill then
 20145	interested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. Were
 20146	farmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? In
 20147	that case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. Did the
 20148	traffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?
 20149	Then live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. Did
 20150	the farmers need credit? Banks must be established close at hand to
 20151	advance it. In all conferences on scientific farm management,
 20152	conservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to
 20153	agriculture and industry, Hill was an active participant. His was the
 20154	long vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the
 20155	foundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.
 20156	
 20157	Indeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the
 20158	lines. He wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat
 20159	stored in warehouses for the lack of markets. So he looked to the Orient
 20160	as well as to Europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. He sent
 20161	agents to China and Japan to discover what American goods and produce
 20162	those countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to
 20163	Americans in exchange. To open the Pacific trade he bought two ocean
 20164	monsters, the _Minnesota_ and the _Dakota_, thus preparing for
 20165	emergencies West as well as East. When some Japanese came to the United
 20166	States on their way to Europe to buy steel rails, Hill showed them how
 20167	easy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by
 20168	way of American railways and American vessels. So the railway builder
 20169	and promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived
 20170	through the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. Before he
 20171	died he saw the wheat fields of North Dakota linked with the spinning
 20172	jennies of Manchester and the docks of Yokohama.
 20173	
 20174	
 20175	THE EVOLUTION OF GRAZING AND AGRICULTURE
 20176	
 20177	=The Removal of the Indians.=--Unlike the frontier of New England in
 20178	colonial days or that of Kentucky later, the advancing lines of home
 20179	builders in the Far West had little difficulty with warlike natives.
 20180	Indian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; General
 20181	Custer had his fatal battle with the Sioux in 1876 and there were minor
 20182	brushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. The former
 20183	practice of treating with the Indians as independent nations was
 20184	abandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations
 20185	where they were mainly supported by the government. The supervision of
 20186	their affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and
 20187	instructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which
 20188	unfortunately was often betrayed. A further step in Indian policy was
 20189	taken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual
 20190	Indians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among
 20191	their white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. The disappearance of
 20192	the buffalo, the main food supply of the wild Indians, had made them
 20193	more tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter
 20194	for the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.
 20195	
 20196	=The Cowboy and Cattle Ranger.=--Between the frontier of farms and the
 20197	mountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for
 20198	grazing. As soon as the railways were open into the Missouri Valley,
 20199	affording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle
 20200	and sheep raising on an immense scale. The far-famed American cowboy was
 20201	the hero in this scene. Great herds of cattle were bred in Texas; with
 20202	the advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward
 20203	across the plains and over the buffalo trails. In a single year, 1884,
 20204	it is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of
 20205	Texas to the North by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000
 20206	horses and ponies.
 20207	
 20208	During the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the
 20209	sheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands
 20210	without paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the
 20211	possession of ranges. At length, however, both had to go, as the
 20212	homesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert
 20213	with endless lines of barbed wire. Already in 1893 a writer familiar
 20214	with the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: "The
 20215	unique position of the cowboys among the Americans is jeopardized in a
 20216	thousand ways. Towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation
 20217	schemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into
 20218	farm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of
 20219	waterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be
 20220	done mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy's
 20221	days will end. Even now his condition disappoints those who knew him
 20222	only half a dozen years ago. His breed seems to have deteriorated and
 20223	his ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the
 20224	love of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into
 20225	that calling. Splendid Cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in
 20226	the outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from Mexico may or
 20227	may not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the
 20228	grazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these
 20229	towns any more. The fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone
 20230	already."
 20231	
 20232	=Settlement under the Homestead Act of 1862.=--Two factors gave a
 20233	special stimulus to the rapid settlement of Western lands which swept
 20234	away the Indians and the cattle rangers. The first was the policy of the
 20235	railway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the
 20236	government at low prices to induce immigration. The second was the
 20237	operation of the Homestead law passed in 1862. This measure practically
 20238	closed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain
 20239	that was suitable for agriculture. It provided for granting, without any
 20240	cost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres
 20241	each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming
 20242	citizens. The one important condition attached was that the settler
 20243	should occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally
 20244	confirmed. Even this stipulation was waived in the case of the Civil War
 20245	veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a
 20246	part of the five years' occupancy required. As the soldiers of the
 20247	Revolutionary and Mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the
 20248	frontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the
 20249	middle border. Along with them went thousands of German, Irish, and
 20250	Scandinavian immigrants, fresh from the Old World. Between 1867 and
 20251	1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In
 20252	twenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to
 20253	almost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from
 20254	600,000 to 1,600,000; and the Dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.
 20255	
 20256	=The Diversity of Western Agriculture.=--In soil, produce, and
 20257	management, Western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the
 20258	East and South. In the region of arable and watered lands the typical
 20259	American unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;
 20260	but by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or Eastern
 20261	companies and tilled by hired labor. Sometimes the great estate took the
 20262	shape of the "bonanza farm" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and
 20263	cultivated on a large scale by machinery. Again it assumed the form of
 20264	the cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. Again it was a
 20265	vast holding of diversified interest, such as the Santa Anita ranch near
 20266	Los Angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres "cultivated in a glorious sweep of
 20267	vineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures
 20268	and horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the Spanish
 20269	owners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate."
 20270	
 20271	=Irrigation.=--In one respect agriculture in the Far West was unique. In
 20272	a large area spreading through eight states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,
 20273	Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of adjoining
 20274	states, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the
 20275	American farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. The Mormons
 20276	were the first Anglo-Saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled
 20277	at first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation
 20278	systems. As other settlers poured into the West the problem of the
 20279	desert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the
 20280	commiseration of Eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop
 20281	out an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and
 20282	stones. Private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built
 20283	irrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. Some
 20284	ranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,
 20285	sank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that "soused
 20286	the thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into
 20287	good-for-anything loam." The federal government came to the aid of the
 20288	arid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for
 20289	irrigation purposes. In this work Wyoming took the lead with a law which
 20290	induced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time
 20291	provided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. Finally
 20292	in 1902 the federal government by its liberal Reclamation Act added its
 20293	strength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering
 20294	"arid America."
 20295	
 20296	"Nowhere," writes Powell, a historian of the West, in his picturesque
 20297	_End of the Trail_, "has the white man fought a more courageous fight or
 20298	won a more brilliant victory than in Arizona. His weapons have been the
 20299	transit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;
 20300	and the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all
 20301	foes--the hostile forces of Nature.... The story of how the white man
 20302	within the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and
 20303	mapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and
 20304	justice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking
 20305	acquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the
 20306	necessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across
 20307	this territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,
 20308	undismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned
 20309	upon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,
 20310	and slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,
 20311	and filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or
 20312	high in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,
 20313	he replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus
 20314	with cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. It
 20315	is one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the Southwest,
 20316	and its heroes, thank God, are Americans.
 20317	
 20318	"Other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--Egypt, for
 20319	example, and Mesopotamia and parts of the Sudan--but the people of all
 20320	those regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,
 20321	metaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than
 20322	themselves to come along and do the work. But the Arizonians, mindful of
 20323	the fact that God, the government, and Carnegie help those who help
 20324	themselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their
 20325	evenings in writing letters to Washington with toil-hardened hands.
 20326	After a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams
 20327	at Laguna and Roosevelt are the result. Then the people, organizing
 20328	themselves into cooperative leagues and water-users' associations, took
 20329	up the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these
 20330	energetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and
 20331	dug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which
 20332	stretches from Yuma to Tucson, that the metamorphosis of Arizona is
 20333	due."
 20334	
 20335	The effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. Stretches of
 20336	sand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,
 20337	corn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. Huge ranches grazed by browsing
 20338	sheep were broken up into small plots. The cowboy and ranchman vanished.
 20339	In their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the
 20340	township of Iowa or the industrial center of the East. Its intensive
 20341	tillage left little room for hired labor. Its small holdings drew
 20342	families together in village life rather than dispersing them on the
 20343	lonely plain. Often the development of water power in connection with
 20344	irrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many
 20345	a burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the
 20346	farmer and his family.
 20347	
 20348	
 20349	MINING AND MANUFACTURING IN THE WEST
 20350	
 20351	=Mineral Resources.=--In another important particular the Far West
 20352	differed from the Mississippi Valley states. That was in the
 20353	predominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.
 20354	Indeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the
 20355	pioneers who first opened the country. The discovery of gold in
 20356	California in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,
 20357	miners, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,
 20358	washed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,
 20359	silver, copper, coal, and other minerals. In Nevada and Montana the
 20360	development of mineral resources went on all during the Civil War. Alder
 20361	Gulch became Virginia City in 1863; Last Chance Gulch was named Helena
 20362	in 1864; and Confederate Gulch was christened Diamond City in 1865. At
 20363	Butte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had
 20364	washed out eight million dollars' worth of gold. Under the gold they
 20365	found silver; under silver they found copper.
 20366	
 20367	Even at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well
 20368	advanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,
 20369	minerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of
 20370	states. This was revealed by the figures for 1910. The gold, silver,
 20371	iron, and copper of Colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and
 20372	oats combined; the copper of Montana sold for more than all the cereals
 20373	and four times the price of the wheat. The interest of Nevada was also
 20374	mainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or
 20375	more than one-half the national debt of Hamilton's day. The yield of the
 20376	mines of Utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of
 20377	Wyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of
 20378	Arizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at
 20379	$1,200,000; while in Idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat
 20380	crop exceed in value the output of the mines.

 20385	
 20386	=Timber Resources.=--The forests of the great West, unlike those of the
 20387	Ohio Valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be
 20388	attacked. In Ohio and Indiana, for example, the frontier line of
 20389	homemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they
 20390	could put out a crop of any size. Beyond the Mississippi, however,
 20391	there were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost
 20392	treeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. In the other
 20393	parts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the
 20394	finest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. They consumed
 20395	acres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and
 20396	telegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for
 20397	their annual upkeep. The surplus trees, such as had burdened the
 20398	pioneers of the Northwest Territory a hundred years before, they carried
 20399	off to markets on the east and west coasts.
 20400	
 20401	=Western Industries.=--The peculiar conditions of the Far West
 20402	stimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.
 20403	The mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called
 20404	for sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and
 20405	refine ores. The ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing
 20406	houses of Kansas City as well as Chicago. The waters of the Northwest
 20407	afforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.
 20408	The fruits and vegetables of California brought into existence
 20409	innumerable canneries. The lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills
 20410	to furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized
 20411	factories for paper, boxes, and furniture. As the railways preceded
 20412	settlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they
 20413	encouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a
 20414	state of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the Ohio Valley in
 20415	the early days before the opening of the Erie Canal.
 20416	
 20417	=Social Effects of Economic Activities.=--In many respects the social
 20418	life of the Far West also differed from that of the Ohio Valley. The
 20419	treeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate
 20420	tilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,
 20421	summoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. The mineral
 20422	resources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations
 20423	of eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. Other
 20424	millionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more
 20425	from the cattle and sheep ranges. In many sections the "cattle king," as
 20426	he was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old South.
 20427	Everywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important
 20428	person. He "sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in
 20429	city property.... He had his rating in the commercial reviews and could
 20430	hobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....
 20431	He attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state
 20432	legislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan 'business
 20433	man' in the race for a seat in Congress. In proportion to their numbers,
 20434	the ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class."
 20435	
 20436	Although many of the early capitalists of the great West, especially
 20437	from Nevada, spent their money principally in the East, others took
 20438	leadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their
 20439	fortunes. A railroad pioneer, General Palmer, built his home at Colorado
 20440	Springs, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. Denver
 20441	owed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of Horace
 20442	Tabor, a wealthy mine owner. Leland Stanford paid his tribute to
 20443	California in the endowment of a large university. Colonel W.F. Cody,
 20444	better known as "Buffalo Bill," started his career by building a "boom
 20445	town" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo
 20446	meat to construction hands (hence his popular name). By his famous Wild
 20447	West Show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the
 20448	promotion of a western reclamation scheme.
 20449	
 20450	While the Far West was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership
 20451	in business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. Even
 20452	the cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in
 20453	that they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,
 20454	and cattlemen at regular wages. At the same time there appeared other
 20455	peculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic
 20456	life. Mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed
 20457	thousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other
 20458	times. The inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering
 20459	from camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without
 20460	fixed homes or established habits of life. From this extraordinary
 20461	condition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital
 20462	and labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole
 20463	sections of the mountain and coast states.
 20464	
 20465	
 20466	THE ADMISSION OF NEW STATES
 20467	
 20468	=The Spirit of Self-Government.=--The instinct of self-government was
 20469	strong in the western communities. In the very beginning, it led to the
 20470	organization of volunteer committees, known as "vigilantes," to suppress
 20471	crime and punish criminals. As soon as enough people were settled
 20472	permanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of
 20473	government. An illustration of this process is found in the Oregon
 20474	compact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected
 20475	in an editorial in an old copy of the _Rocky Mountain News_: "We claim
 20476	that any body or community of American citizens which from any cause or
 20477	under any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated
 20478	as not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central
 20479	government, have a right, if on American soil, to frame a government and
 20480	enact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own
 20481	safety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,
 20482	that they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government
 20483	shall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their
 20484	unqualified support and obedience."
 20485	
 20486	People who turned so naturally to the organization of local
 20487	administration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as
 20488	any shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. As long as a
 20489	region was merely one of the territories of the United States, the
 20490	appointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by
 20491	politics at Washington. Moreover the disposition of land, mineral
 20492	rights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national
 20493	leaders. Thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of
 20494	independence in the quest for local autonomy.
 20495	
 20496	=Nebraska and Colorado.=--Two states, Nebraska and Colorado, had little
 20497	difficulty in securing admission to the union. The first, Nebraska, had
 20498	been organized as a territory by the famous Kansas-Nebraska bill which
 20499	did so much to precipitate the Civil War. Lying to the north of Kansas,
 20500	which had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners
 20501	from Missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the North. Though
 20502	it claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly
 20503	interest by the Republican Congress at Washington and, reduced to its
 20504	present boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.
 20505	
 20506	This was hardly accomplished before the people of Colorado to the
 20507	southwest began to make known their demands. They had been organized
 20508	under territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;
 20509	but within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.
 20510	The silver and gold deposits of the Leadville and Cripple Creek regions
 20511	had attracted an army of miners and prospectors. The city of Denver,
 20512	founded in 1858 and named after the governor of Kansas whence came many
 20513	of the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into
 20514	a prosperous center of trade. By 1875 it was reckoned that the
 20515	population of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the
 20516	following year Congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made Colorado a
 20517	member of the American union.
 20518	
 20519	=Six New States (1889-1890).=--For many years there was a deadlock in
 20520	Congress over the admission of new states. The spell was broken in 1889
 20521	under the leadership of the Dakotas. For a long time the Dakota
 20522	territory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the
 20523	powerful Sioux Indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of
 20524	the frontier. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, however, marked
 20525	their doom. Even before Congress could open their lands to prospectors,
 20526	pioneers were swarming over the country. Farmers from the adjoining
 20527	Minnesota and the Eastern states, Scandinavians, Germans, and Canadians,
 20528	came in swelling waves to occupy the fertile Dakota lands, now famous
 20529	even as far away as the fjords of Norway. Seldom had the plow of man cut
 20530	through richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the Red River
 20531	Valley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the
 20532	Northern Pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and
 20533	west. The population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the
 20534	half million mark before ten years had elapsed.
 20535	
 20536	Remembering that Nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000
 20537	inhabitants, the Dakotans could not see why they should be kept under
 20538	federal tutelage. At the same time Washington, far away on the Pacific
 20539	Coast, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, boasting of their populations and
 20540	their riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. But the members of
 20541	Congress were busy with politics. The Democrats saw no good reason for
 20542	admitting new Republican states until after their defeat in 1888. Near
 20543	the end of their term the next year they opened the door for North and
 20544	South Dakota, Washington, and Montana. In 1890, a Republican Congress
 20545	brought Idaho and Wyoming into the union, the latter with woman
 20546	suffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.
 20547	
 20548	=Utah.=--Although Utah had long presented all the elements of a
 20549	well-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was
 20550	delayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. The
 20551	custom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of Congress in 1862; but
 20552	the law had been systematically evaded. In 1882 Congress made another
 20553	and more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. Five years later it
 20554	even went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the
 20555	Mormon Church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.
 20556	Meanwhile the Gentile or non-Mormon population was steadily increasing
 20557	and the leaders in the Church became convinced that the battle
 20558	against the sentiment of the country was futile. At last in 1896 Utah
 20559	was admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural
 20560	marriages absolutely and forever. Horace Greeley, who visited Utah in
 20561	1859, had prophesied that the Pacific Railroad would work a revolution
 20562	in the land of Brigham Young. His prophecy had come true.
 20563	
 20564	[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1912]
 20565	
 20566	=Rounding out the Continent.=--Three more territories now remained out
 20567	of the Union. Oklahoma, long an Indian reservation, had been opened for
 20568	settlement to white men in 1889. The rush upon the fertile lands of this
 20569	region, the last in the history of America, was marked by all the frenzy
 20570	of the final, desperate chance. At a signal from a bugle an army of men
 20571	with families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst
 20572	into the territory. During the first night a city of tents was raised at
 20573	Guthrie and Oklahoma City. In ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.
 20574	In a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and
 20575	newspapers. Within fifteen years there was a population of more than
 20576	half a million. To the west, Arizona with a population of about 125,000
 20577	and New Mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined Oklahoma in asking for
 20578	statehood. Congress, then Republican, looked with reluctance upon the
 20579	addition of more Democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally
 20580	compelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit Oklahoma.
 20581	In 1910 the House of Representatives went to the Democrats and within
 20582	two years Arizona and New Mexico were "under the roof." So the
 20583	continental domain was rounded out.
 20584	
 20585	
 20586	THE INFLUENCE OF THE FAR WEST ON NATIONAL LIFE
 20587	
 20588	=The Last of the Frontier.=--When Horace Greeley made his trip west in
 20589	1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:
 20590	
 20591	     "May 12th, Chicago.--Chocolate and morning journals last
 20592	     seen on the hotel breakfast table.
 20593	
 20594	     23rd, Leavenworth (Kansas).--Room bells and bath tubs make
 20595	     their final appearance.
 20596	
 20597	     26th, Manhattan.--Potatoes and eggs last recognized among
 20598	     the blessings that 'brighten as they take their flight.'
 20599	
 20600	     27th, Junction City.--Last visitation of a boot-black, with
 20601	     dissolving views of a board bedroom. Beds bid us good-by."
 20602	
 20603	[Illustration: _Copyright by Panama-California Exposition_
 20604	
 20605	THE CANADIAN BUILDING AT THE PANAMA-CALIFORNIA INTERNATIONAL
 20606	EXPOSITION, SAN DIEGO, 1915]
 20607	
 20608	Within thirty years travelers were riding across that country in Pullman
 20609	cars and enjoying at the hotels all the comforts of a standardized
 20610	civilization. The "wild west" was gone, and with it that frontier of
 20611	pioneers and settlers who had long given such a bent and tone to
 20612	American life and had "poured in upon the floor of Congress" such a long
 20613	line of "backwoods politicians," as they were scornfully styled.
 20614	
 20615	=Free Land and Eastern Labor.=--It was not only the picturesque features
 20616	of the frontier that were gone. Of far more consequence was the
 20617	disappearance of free lands with all that meant for American labor. For
 20618	more than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able
 20619	to secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. For a
 20620	hundred years America had been able to supply farms to as many
 20621	immigrants as cared to till the soil. Every new pair of strong arms
 20622	meant more farms and more wealth. Workmen in Eastern factories, mines,
 20623	or mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,
 20624	could readily find an outlet to the land. Now all that was over. By
 20625	about 1890 most of the desirable land available under the Homestead act
 20626	had disappeared. American industrial workers confronted a new situation.
 20627	
 20628	=Grain Supplants King Cotton.=--In the meantime a revolution was taking
 20629	place in agriculture. Until 1860 the chief staples sold by America were
 20630	cotton and tobacco. With the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat
 20631	supplanted them both in agrarian economy. The West became the granary of
 20632	the East and of Western Europe. The scoop shovel once used to handle
 20633	grain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading
 20634	thousands of bushels every hour. The refrigerator car and ship made the
 20635	packing industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave
 20636	an immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. So the meat of
 20637	the West took its place on the English dinner table by the side of bread
 20638	baked from Dakotan wheat.
 20639	
 20640	=Aid in American Economic Independence.=--The effects of this economic
 20641	movement were manifold and striking. Billions of dollars' worth of
 20642	American grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into European
 20643	markets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired
 20644	capital to develop American resources. Thus they accelerated the
 20645	progress of American financiers toward national independence. The
 20646	country, which had timidly turned to the Old World for capital in
 20647	Hamilton's day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in London in
 20648	Lincoln's day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the
 20649	world's first bankers and money lenders itself. Every grain of wheat and
 20650	corn pulled the balance down on the American side of the scale.
 20651	
 20652	=Eastern Agriculture Affected.=--In the East as well as abroad the
 20653	opening of the western granary produced momentous results. The
 20654	agricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many
 20655	respects. Whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of
 20656	cultivation, the abandoned farms of the New England hills bearing solemn
 20657	witness to the competing power of western wheat fields. Sheep and cattle
 20658	raising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a
 20659	relative decline. Thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower
 20660	grade were forced to go West or were driven to the margin of
 20661	subsistence. Even the herds that supplied Eastern cities with milk were
 20662	fed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.
 20663	
 20664	=The Expansion of the American Market.=--Upon industry as well as
 20665	agriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a
 20666	thousand ways. The demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,
 20667	and other manufactures gave to American industries such a market as even
 20668	Hamilton had never foreseen. Moreover it helped to expand far into the
 20669	Mississippi Valley the industrial area once confined to the Northern
 20670	seaboard states and to transform the region of the Great Lakes into an
 20671	industrial empire. Herein lies the explanation of the growth of
 20672	mid-western cities after 1865. Chicago, with its thirty-five railways,
 20673	tapped every locality of the West and South. To the railways were added
 20674	the water routes of the Lakes, thus creating a strategic center for
 20675	industries. Long foresight carried the McCormick reaper works to
 20676	Chicago before 1860. From Troy, New York, went a large stove plant. That
 20677	was followed by a shoe factory from Massachusetts. The packing industry
 20678	rose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers
 20679	and shippers and so well connected with Eastern markets.
 20680	
 20681	To the opening of the Far West also the Lake region was indebted for a
 20682	large part of that water-borne traffic which made it "the Mediterranean
 20683	basin of North America." The produce of the West and the manufactures of
 20684	the East poured through it in an endless stream. The swift growth of
 20685	shipbuilding on the Great Lakes helped to compensate for the decline of
 20686	the American marine on the high seas. In response to this stimulus
 20687	Detroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten
 20688	thousand ton Leviathan for ore or grain about "as quickly as carpenters
 20689	could put up an eight-room house." Thus in relation to the Far West the
 20690	old Northwest territory--the wilderness of Jefferson's time--had taken
 20691	the position formerly occupied by New England alone. It was supplying
 20692	capital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire West and South.
 20693	
 20694	=America on the Pacific.=--It has been said that the Mediterranean Sea
 20695	was the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has
 20696	developed on the shores of the Atlantic; and that the future belongs to
 20697	the Pacific. At any rate, the sweep of the United States to the shores
 20698	of the Pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs
 20699	and it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.
 20700	
 20701	Very early regular traffic sprang up between the Pacific ports and the
 20702	Hawaiian Islands, China, and Japan. Two years before the adjustment of
 20703	the Oregon controversy with England, namely in 1844, the United States
 20704	had established official and trading relations with China. Ten years
 20705	later, four years after the admission of California to the union, the
 20706	barred door of Japan was forced open by Commodore Perry. The commerce
 20707	which had long before developed between the Pacific ports and Hawaii,
 20708	China, and Japan now flourished under official care. In 1865 a ship
 20709	from Honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from Hawaii to the
 20710	Oregon port of Astoria. The next year a vessel from Hongkong brought
 20711	rice, mats, and tea from China. An era of lucrative trade was opened.
 20712	The annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the addition of the Philippines at the
 20713	same time, and the participation of American troops in the suppression
 20714	of the Boxer rebellion in Peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of
 20715	American power on the Pacific.

 20720	
 20721	=Conservation and the Land Problem.=--The disappearance of the frontier
 20722	also brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states
 20723	and the nation. The people of the whole United States suddenly were
 20724	forced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to
 20725	exploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.
 20726	Then arose in America the questions which had long perplexed the
 20727	countries of the Old World--the scientific use of the soils and
 20728	conservation of natural resources. Hitherto the government had followed
 20729	the easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral
 20730	lands at low prices. Now it had to face far more difficult and complex
 20731	problems. It also had to consider questions of land tenure again,
 20732	especially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be
 20733	maintained. While there was plenty of land for every man or woman who
 20734	wanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords
 20735	or companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in
 20736	one western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land
 20737	for small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. At
 20738	the opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years
 20739	before had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was
 20740	compelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.
 20741	Then it was that the great state of California, on the very border of
 20742	the continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure
 20743	providing government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings
 20744	into small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small
 20745	farms. America was passing into a new epoch.

 20839	CHAPTER XIX
 20840	
 20841	DOMESTIC ISSUES BEFORE THE COUNTRY (1865-1897)
 20842	
 20843	
 20844	For thirty years after the Civil War the leading political parties,
 20845	although they engaged in heated presidential campaigns, were not sharply
 20846	and clearly opposed on many matters of vital significance. During none
 20847	of that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as
 20848	rent the country in 1800 when Jefferson rode a popular wave to victory,
 20849	or again in 1828 when Jackson's western hordes came sweeping into power.
 20850	The Democrats, who before 1860 definitely opposed protective tariffs,
 20851	federal banking, internal improvements, and heavy taxes, now spoke
 20852	cautiously on all these points. The Republicans, conscious of the fact
 20853	that they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the
 20854	early loss of the House of Representatives in 1874, also moved with
 20855	considerable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. Again
 20856	and again the votes in Congress showed that no clear line separated all
 20857	the Democrats from all the Republicans. There were Republicans who
 20858	favored tariff reductions and "cheap money." There were Democrats who
 20859	looked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the
 20860	contraction of the currency. Only on matters relating to the coercion of
 20861	the South was the division between the parties fairly definite; this
 20862	could be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental
 20863	grounds.
 20864	
 20865	After all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into
 20866	the political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing
 20867	in the country. The fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875
 20868	and 1893, the Democrats held the House of Representatives for fourteen
 20869	years while the Republicans had every President but one showed that the
 20870	voters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. Hayes had a
 20871	Democratic House during his entire term and a Democratic Senate for two
 20872	years of the four. Cleveland was confronted by a belligerent Republican
 20873	majority in the Senate during his first administration; and at the same
 20874	time was supported by a Democratic majority in the House. Harrison was
 20875	sustained by continuous Republican successes in Senatorial elections;
 20876	but in the House he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost
 20877	that altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. The
 20878	opinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. It was
 20879	still distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the
 20880	trend of the future.
 20881	
 20882	
 20883	THE CURRENCY QUESTION
 20884	
 20885	Nevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved
 20886	to be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great
 20887	campaign of 1896. Except for three new features--the railways, the
 20888	trusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people
 20889	were the same as those that had engaged their attention since the
 20890	foundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,
 20891	the tariff, and taxation.
 20892	
 20893	=Debtors and the Fall in Prices.=--For many reasons the currency
 20894	question occupied the center of interest. As of old, the farmers and
 20895	planters of the West and South were heavily in debt to the East for
 20896	borrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale
 20897	of cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when
 20898	due. During the war, the Western farmers had been able to dispose of
 20899	their produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with
 20900	comparative ease; but after the war prices declined. Wheat that sold at
 20901	two dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years
 20902	later. The meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly
 20903	three-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single
 20904	illustration. A thousand-dollar mortgage on a Western farm could be paid
 20905	off by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it
 20906	took about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was
 20907	at the bottom of the scale. For the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat
 20908	was the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer
 20909	sun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.
 20910	
 20911	=Creditors and Falling Prices.=--To the bondholders or creditors, on the
 20912	other hand, falling prices were clear gain. If a fifty-dollar coupon on
 20913	a bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or
 20914	thirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. Moreover
 20915	the advantage seemed to him entirely just. Creditors had suffered heavy
 20916	losses when the Civil War carried prices skyward while the interest
 20917	rates on their old bonds remained stationary. For example, if a man had
 20918	a $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he
 20919	received fifty dollars a year from it. Before the war each dollar would
 20920	buy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. When
 20921	prices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors
 20922	therefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to
 20923	normal conditions.
 20924	
 20925	=The Cause of Falling Prices.=--The fall in prices was due, no doubt, to
 20926	many factors. Among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of
 20927	government buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,
 20928	immigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. The currency,
 20929	too, was an element in the situation. Whatever the cause, the
 20930	discontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue
 20931	more money. They viewed it as a case of supply and demand. If there was
 20932	a small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there
 20933	was a large volume, prices would be high. Hence they looked with favor
 20934	upon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. First
 20935	they advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to
 20936	silver as the remedy. The creditors, on the other hand, naturally
 20937	approved the reduction of the volume of currency. They wished to see the
 20938	greenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in
 20939	volume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.
 20940	
 20941	=The Battle over the Greenbacks.=--The contest between these factions
 20942	began as early as 1866. In that year, Congress enacted a law authorizing
 20943	the Treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. The paper
 20944	money party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,
 20945	in 1878, it forced Congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of
 20946	the legal tender notes as they came into the Treasury in payment of
 20947	taxes and other dues. Then could the friends of easy money rejoice:
 20948	
 20949	    "Thou, Greenback, 'tis of thee
 20950	     Fair money of the free,
 20951	      Of thee we sing."
 20952	
 20953	=Resumption of Specie Payment.=--There was, however, another side to
 20954	this victory. The opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the
 20955	circulation of paper, induced Congress to pass a law in 1875 providing
 20956	that on and after January 1, 1879, "the Secretary of the Treasury shall
 20957	redeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then outstanding on
 20958	their presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the
 20959	United States in the City of New York in sums of not less than fifty
 20960	dollars." "The way to resume," John Sherman had said, "is to resume."
 20961	When the hour for redemption arrived, the Treasury was prepared with a
 20962	large hoard of gold. "On the appointed day," wrote the assistant
 20963	secretary, "anxiety reigned in the office of the Treasury. Hour after
 20964	hour passed; no news from New York. Inquiry by wire showed that all was
 20965	quiet. At the close of the day this message came: '$135,000 of notes
 20966	presented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.' That was all.
 20967	Resumption was accomplished with no disturbance. By five o'clock the
 20968	news was all over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their
 20969	tea in absolute safety."
 20970	
 20971	=The Specie Problem--the Parity of Gold and Silver.=--Defeated in their
 20972	efforts to stop "the present suicidal and destructive policy of
 20973	contraction," the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase
 20974	in the volume of silver in circulation. This precipitated one of the
 20975	sharpest political battles in American history. The issue turned on
 20976	legal as well as economic points. The Constitution gave Congress the
 20977	power to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold
 20978	and silver legal tender in the payment of debts. It evidently
 20979	contemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. Such, at
 20980	least, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a
 20981	personage than James G. Blaine. The difficulty, however, lay in
 20982	maintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to
 20983	circulate with equal facility. Obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar
 20984	exceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,
 20985	men will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. When,
 20986	for example, Congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one
 20987	to fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was
 20988	soon found that gold had been undervalued. When again in 1834 the ratio
 20989	was put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.
 20990	Consequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver
 20991	almost dropped out of circulation. Many a silver dollar was melted down
 20992	by silverware factories.
 20993	
 20994	=Silver Demonetized in 1873.=--So things stood in 1873. At that time,
 20995	Congress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the
 20996	standard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. This act
 20997	was denounced later by the friends of silver as "the crime of '73," a
 20998	conspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. This
 20999	contention the debates in Congress do not seem to sustain. In the course
 21000	of the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at
 21001	least: "This bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender
 21002	coin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only
 21003	one metal instead of two as heretofore."
 21004	
 21005	=The Decline in the Value of Silver.=--Absorbed in the greenback
 21006	controversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the
 21007	significance of the "demonetization" of silver; but within a few years
 21008	several events united in making it the center of a political storm.
 21009	Germany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand
 21010	for gold. Three years later, the countries of the Latin Union followed
 21011	this example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. All
 21012	the while, new silver lodes, discovered in the Far West, were pouring
 21013	into the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the
 21014	price. Then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,
 21015	placed the paper money on a gold basis. Within twenty years silver was
 21016	worth in gold only about half the price of 1870.
 21017	
 21018	That there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends
 21019	of that metal. They alleged that gold had gone up because it had been
 21020	given a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. This
 21021	monopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the
 21022	people conceived by the bankers of the world. Moreover, they went on,
 21023	the placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a
 21024	contraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce
 21025	to the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed
 21026	rate of interest. When wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their
 21027	search for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their
 21028	efforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of
 21029	silver at the ratio of sixteen to one.
 21030	
 21031	=Republicans and Democrats Divided.=--On this question both Republicans
 21032	and Democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the East on the
 21033	one hand and the South and West on the other, rather than between the
 21034	two leading parties. So trusted a leader as James G. Blaine avowed, in a
 21035	speech delivered in the Senate in 1878, that, as the Constitution
 21036	required Congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,
 21037	the only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. He
 21038	affirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a
 21039	reopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it
 21040	up to its old relation with gold. He admitted also that their most
 21041	ominous warnings were well founded, saying: "I believe the struggle now
 21042	going on in this country and in other countries for a single gold
 21043	standard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout
 21044	the commercial world. The destruction of silver as money and the
 21045	establishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous
 21046	effect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a
 21047	fixed return."
 21048	
 21049	This was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.
 21050	"Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted
 21051	on borrowed capital," said Senator Jones, of Nevada. "Three-fourths of
 21052	the homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have
 21053	been bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged
 21054	for the payment of some part of the purchase money. Under the operation
 21055	of a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,
 21056	at the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no
 21057	more than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the
 21058	amount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater
 21059	than they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... In
 21060	all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the
 21061	equities involved by sneering at the debtors."
 21062	
 21063	=The Silver Purchase Act (1878).=--Even before the actual resumption of
 21064	specie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned
 21065	with, particularly in the Democratic party. They had a majority in the
 21066	House of Representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through
 21067	that chamber. Blocked by the Republican Senate they accepted a
 21068	compromise in the Bland-Allison bill, which provided for huge monthly
 21069	purchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. So
 21070	strong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after
 21071	President Hayes vetoed the measure.
 21072	
 21073	The effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. It
 21074	did not stay silver on its downward course. Thereupon the silver faction
 21075	pressed through Congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper
 21076	certificates based on the silver accumulated in the Treasury. Still
 21077	silver continued to fall. Then the advocates of inflation declared that
 21078	they would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of
 21079	sixteen to one. If the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there
 21080	is good reason for believing that free silver would have received a
 21081	majority in both houses of Congress; but it was not presented.
 21082	
 21083	=The Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Bond Sales.=--Republican
 21084	leaders, particularly from the East, stemmed the silver tide by a
 21085	diversion of forces. They passed the Sherman Act of 1890 providing for
 21086	large monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable
 21087	in gold or silver at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. In
 21088	a clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was "the established
 21089	policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with
 21090	each other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be
 21091	provided by law." For a while silver was buoyed up. Then it turned once
 21092	more on its downward course. In the meantime the Treasury was in a sad
 21093	plight. To maintain the gold reserve, President Cleveland felt compelled
 21094	to sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the
 21095	gold was brought in at the front door of the Treasury, notes were
 21096	presented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the
 21097	back door. Alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon
 21098	Congress the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. For this he was
 21099	roundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct
 21100	as "treason to the party"; but the Republicans, especially from the
 21101	East, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of
 21102	the law from the statute book. The anger of the silver faction knew no
 21103	bounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential
 21104	campaign.
 21105	
 21106	
 21107	THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND TAXATION
 21108	
 21109	=Fluctuation in Tariff Policy.=--As each of the old parties was divided
 21110	on the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some
 21111	confusion in their ranks over the tariff. Like the silver issue, the
 21112	tariff tended to align the manufacturing East against the agricultural
 21113	West and South rather than to cut directly between the two parties.
 21114	Still the Republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed
 21115	during the Civil War. If we except the reductions of 1872 which were
 21116	soon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially
 21117	unchanged for nearly twenty years. When a revision was brought about,
 21118	however, it was initiated by Republican leaders. Seeing a huge surplus
 21119	of revenue in the Treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by
 21120	revising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its
 21121	friends rather than by its enemies. On the other hand, it was the
 21122	Republicans also who enacted the McKinley tariff bill of 1890, which
 21123	carried protection to its highest point up to that time.
 21124	
 21125	The Democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even
 21126	advocates of tariff for revenue only. In Cleveland's first
 21127	administration they did attack the protective system in the House, where
 21128	they had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the
 21129	President. The assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it
 21130	was blocked by the Republicans in the Senate. When, after the sweeping
 21131	victory of 1892, the Democrats in the House again attempted to bring
 21132	down the tariff by the Wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by
 21133	their own party colleagues in the upper chamber. In the end they were
 21134	driven into a compromise that looked more like a McKinley than a Calhoun
 21135	tariff. The Republicans taunted them with being "babes in the woods."
 21136	President Cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to
 21137	sign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without
 21138	his approval.
 21139	
 21140	=The Income Tax of 1894.=--The advocates of tariff reduction usually
 21141	associated with their proposal a tax on incomes. The argument which
 21142	they advanced in support of their program was simple. Most of the
 21143	industries, they said, are in the East and the protective tariff which
 21144	taxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a
 21145	tribute laid upon the rest of the country. As an offset they offered a
 21146	tax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich
 21147	people in the East, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of
 21148	protection. "We propose," said one of them, "to place a part of the
 21149	burden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it
 21150	all upon the consumption of the people." In this spirit the sponsors of
 21151	the Wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or
 21152	more.
 21153	
 21154	In taking this step, the Democrats encountered opposition in their own
 21155	party. Senator Hill, of New York, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:
 21156	"The professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the
 21157	anarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...
 21158	principles of taxation." Even the Eastern Republicans were hardly as
 21159	savage in their denunciation of the tax. But all this labor was wasted.
 21160	The next year the Supreme Court of the United States declared the income
 21161	tax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid
 21162	on incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according
 21163	to population. The fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this
 21164	decision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both
 21165	parties.
 21166	
 21167	
 21168	THE RAILWAYS AND TRUSTS
 21169	
 21170	=The Grangers and State Regulation.=--The same uncertainty about the
 21171	railways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the Republicans and Democrats.
 21172	As to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their
 21173	regulation came from the West. There the farmers, in the early
 21174	seventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in
 21175	Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the
 21176	maximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and
 21177	passengers. The application of these measures, however, was limited
 21178	because the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and
 21179	passengers beyond its own borders. The power of regulating interstate
 21180	commerce, under the Constitution, belonged to Congress.
 21181	
 21182	=The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.=--Within a few years, the movement
 21183	which had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at
 21184	Washington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of
 21185	interstate rates. In 1887, the pressure became so strong that Congress
 21186	created the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on
 21187	the part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one
 21188	shipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. This
 21189	law was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of
 21190	rate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.
 21191	
 21192	=The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.=--As in the case of the railways,
 21193	attacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it
 21194	became the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed
 21195	monopolies and "conspired to enhance prices." Republicans and Democrats
 21196	united in the promotion of measures of this kind. As in the case of the
 21197	railways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at
 21198	Washington. Though Blaine had declared that "trusts were largely a
 21199	private affair with which neither the President nor any private citizen
 21200	had any particular right to interfere," it was a Republican Congress
 21201	that enacted in 1890 the first measure--the Sherman Anti-Trust
 21202	Law--directed against great combinations in business. This act declared
 21203	illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,
 21204	or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several
 21205	states or with foreign nations."
 21206	
 21207	=The Futility of the Anti-Trust Law.=--Whether the Sherman law was
 21208	directed against all combinations or merely those which placed an
 21209	"unreasonable restraint" on trade and competition was not apparent.
 21210	Senator Platt of Connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,
 21211	averred: "The questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how
 21212	it would operate, or whether it was within the power of Congress to
 21213	enact it, have been whistled down the wind in this Senate as idle talk
 21214	and the whole effort has been to get some bill headed: 'A bill to punish
 21215	trusts,' with which to go to the country." Whatever its purpose, its
 21216	effect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations
 21217	was negligible. It was practically unenforced by President Harrison and
 21218	President Cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action
 21219	against "monopolies." It was patent that neither the Republicans nor the
 21220	Democrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.
 21221	
 21222	
 21223	THE MINOR PARTIES AND UNREST
 21224	
 21225	=The Demands of Dissenting Parties.=--From the election of 1872, when
 21226	Horace Greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there
 21227	appeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more
 21228	parties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and
 21229	farmers. Whether they chose to call themselves Labor Reformers,
 21230	Greenbackers, or Anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all
 21231	pointed in one direction. Even the Prohibitionists, who in 1872 started
 21232	on their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor
 21233	traffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters
 21234	and hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.
 21235	
 21236	A composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties
 21237	from the administration of Grant to the close of Cleveland's second term
 21238	reveals certain notions common to them all. These included among many
 21239	others: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation
 21240	of the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie
 21241	resumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the
 21242	government convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;
 21243	unlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance
 21244	tax; legislation to take from "land, railroad, money, and other gigantic
 21245	corporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly
 21246	usurped"; popular or direct election of United States Senators; woman
 21247	suffrage; and a graduated income tax, "placing the burden of government
 21248	on those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers
 21249	and producers."
 21250	
 21251	=Criticism of the Old Parties.=--To this long program of measures the
 21252	reformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and
 21253	sometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.
 21254	"We denounce," exclaimed the Labor party in 1888, "the Democratic and
 21255	Republican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason
 21256	of their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages
 21257	of those who do not live upon public plunder." "The United States
 21258	Senate," insisted the Greenbackers, "is a body composed largely of
 21259	aristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers
 21260	generally purchased their elections in order to protect the great
 21261	monopolies which they represent." Indeed, if their platforms are to be
 21262	accepted at face value, the Greenbackers believed that the entire
 21263	government had passed out of the hands of the people.
 21264	
 21265	=The Grangers.=--This unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of
 21266	American political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the
 21267	Middle West. Always active in politics, they had, before the Civil War,
 21268	cast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.
 21269	In 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the
 21270	"Patrons of Husbandry," which was destined to play a large role in the
 21271	partisan contests of the succeeding decades. This society, which
 21272	organized local lodges or "granges" on principles of secrecy and
 21273	fraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the
 21274	interests of the farmers. Its political bearings were apparently not
 21275	grasped at first by its promoters. Yet, appealing as it did to the most
 21276	active and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself
 21277	the strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself
 21278	in the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. Where a few
 21279	votes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.
 21280	
 21281	=The Greenback Party.=--The first extensive activity of the Grangers was
 21282	connected with the attack on the railways in the Middle West which
 21283	forced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates
 21284	by law. At the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt
 21285	emboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,
 21286	popularly known as the Greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of
 21287	the legal tenders. The beginnings were disappointing; but two years
 21288	later, in the congressional elections, the Greenbackers swept whole
 21289	sections of the country. Their candidates polled more than a million
 21290	votes and fourteen of them were returned to the House of
 21291	Representatives. To all outward signs a new and formidable party had
 21292	entered the lists.
 21293	
 21294	The sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. The quiet
 21295	operations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of
 21296	industry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the Silver
 21297	Purchase Act, and the re-issue of Greenbacks cut away some of the
 21298	grounds of agitation. There was also a diversion of forces to the silver
 21299	faction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the
 21300	West. At all events the Greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the
 21301	election of 1880. A still greater drop came four years later and the
 21302	party gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former
 21303	allegiance or sulking in their tents.
 21304	
 21305	=The Rise of the Populist Party.=--Those leaders of the old parties who
 21306	now looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to
 21307	disappointment. The funeral of the Greenback party was hardly over
 21308	before there arose two other political specters in the agrarian
 21309	sections: the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union,
 21310	particularly strong in the South and West; and the Farmers' Alliance,
 21311	operating in the North. By 1890 the two orders claimed over three
 21312	million members. As in the case of the Grangers many years before, the
 21313	leaders among them found an easy way into politics. In 1892 they held a
 21314	convention, nominated a candidate for President, and adopted the name of
 21315	"People's Party," from which they were known as Populists. Their
 21316	platform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. They declared
 21317	that "the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion
 21318	silenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the
 21319	land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... The fruits of the
 21320	toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a
 21321	few." Having delivered this sweeping indictment, the Populists put
 21322	forward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income
 21323	tax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and
 21324	telegraphs. At the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,
 21325	and popular election of Senators, and condemned the use of federal
 21326	troops in labor disputes. On this platform, the Populists polled over a
 21327	million votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a
 21328	powerful delegation to Congress.
 21329	
 21330	=Industrial Distress Augments Unrest.=--The four years intervening
 21331	between the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought
 21332	forth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the
 21333	portentous platform of Populism. Cleveland, a consistent enemy of free
 21334	silver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on
 21335	the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, thus alienating an increasing
 21336	number of his own party. In 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the
 21337	land: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling
 21338	rapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting
 21339	for work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.
 21340	Labor disputes also filled the crowded record. A strike at the Pullman
 21341	car works in Chicago spread to the railways. Disorders ensued. President
 21342	Cleveland, against the protests of the governor of Illinois, John P.
 21343	Altgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. The United States
 21344	district court at Chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president
 21345	of the Railway Union, Eugene V. Debs, or his assistants to interfere
 21346	with the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.
 21347	For refusing to obey the order, Debs was arrested and imprisoned. With
 21348	federal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,
 21349	the strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. To cap the
 21350	climax the Supreme Court of the United States, the following year (1895)
 21351	declared null and void the income tax law just enacted by Congress, thus
 21352	fanning the flames of Populist discontent all over the West and South.
 21353	
 21354	
 21355	THE SOUND MONEY BATTLE OF 1896
 21356	
 21357	=Conservative Men Alarmed.=--Men of conservative thought and leaning in
 21358	both parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. They looked upon
 21359	the rise of Populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a
 21360	revolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to American
 21361	institutions and ideals. The income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the
 21362	distinguished New York advocate, Joseph H. Choate, in an impassioned
 21363	speech before the Supreme Court, "is communistic in its purposes and
 21364	tendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,
 21365	socialistic--what shall I call them--populistic as ever have been
 21366	addressed to any political assembly in the world." Mr. Justice Field in
 21367	the name of the Court replied: "The present assault upon capital is but
 21368	the beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and
 21369	more sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the
 21370	poor against the rich." In declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he
 21371	believed that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.
 21372	As for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling
 21373	it a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors
 21374	to pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the
 21375	climax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and
 21376	honor.
 21377	
 21378	=The Republicans Come Out for the Gold Standard.=--It was among the
 21379	Republicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. It
 21380	was they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the Populists, though a
 21381	host of Democrats, like Cleveland and Hill of New York, also battled
 21382	against the growing Populist defection in Democratic ranks. When the
 21383	Republican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon
 21384	cast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international
 21385	agreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. The Republican party,
 21386	to use the vigorous language of Mr. Lodge, arrayed itself against "not
 21387	only that organized failure, the Democratic party, but all the wandering
 21388	forces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times
 21389	when the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false
 21390	lights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks."
 21391	Yet it is due to historic truth to state that McKinley, whom the
 21392	Republicans nominated, had voted in Congress for the free coinage of
 21393	silver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty
 21394	persuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard
 21395	which was pressed upon him by his counselors. Having accepted it,
 21396	however, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest
 21397	was undoubtedly in the protective tariff. To him nothing was more
 21398	reprehensible than attempts "to array class against class, 'the classes
 21399	against the masses,' section against section, labor against capital,
 21400	'the poor against the rich,' or interest against interest." Such was the
 21401	language of his acceptance speech. The whole program of Populism he now
 21402	viewed as a "sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and
 21403	order."
 21404	
 21405	=The Democratic Convention at Chicago.=--Never, save at the great
 21406	disruption on the eve of the Civil War, did a Democratic national
 21407	convention display more feeling than at Chicago in 1896. From the
 21408	opening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every
 21409	speech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed
 21410	dissensions. Departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a
 21411	proposal to praise the administration of the Democratic President,
 21412	Cleveland. When the platform with its radical planks, including free
 21413	silver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. Senator Hill, trembling
 21414	with emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of
 21415	Democratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the
 21416	party men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,
 21417	unwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. Senator
 21418	Vilas of Wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference
 21419	in principle between the free coinage of silver--"the confiscation of
 21420	one-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors"--and
 21421	communism itself--"a universal distribution of property." In the triumph
 21422	of that cause he saw the beginning of "the overthrow of all law, all
 21423	justice, all security and repose in the social order."
 21424	
 21425	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
 21426	
 21427	WILLIAM J. BRYAN IN 1898]
 21428	
 21429	=The Crown of Thorns Speech.=--The champions of free silver replied in
 21430	strident tones. They accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors
 21431	who had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. William Jennings
 21432	Bryan, of Nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. He
 21433	declared that their cause "was as holy as the cause of liberty--the
 21434	cause of humanity." He exclaimed that the contest was between the idle
 21435	holders of idle capital and the toiling millions. Then he named those
 21436	for whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small
 21437	merchant, the farmer, and the miner. "The man who is employed for wages
 21438	is as much a business man as his employer. The attorney in a country
 21439	town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great
 21440	metropolis. The merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business
 21441	man as the merchant of New York. The farmer ... is as much a business
 21442	man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price
 21443	of grain. The miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two
 21444	thousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few
 21445	financial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....
 21446	It is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Ours is not
 21447	a war of conquest. We are fighting in defense of our homes, our
 21448	families, and our posterity. We have petitioned and our petitions have
 21449	been scorned. We have entreated and our entreaties have been
 21450	disregarded. We have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.
 21451	We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy
 21452	them.... We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to
 21453	them, 'You shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.
 21454	You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.'"
 21455	
 21456	=Bryan Nominated.=--In all the history of national conventions never had
 21457	an orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even Yancey in his
 21458	memorable plea in the Charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and
 21459	moving eloquence, he espoused the Southern cause against the impending
 21460	fates. The delegates, after cheering Mr. Bryan until they could cheer no
 21461	more, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the Nebraska
 21462	delegation to renew the deafening applause. The platform as reported was
 21463	carried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the West,
 21464	hailed as America's Tiberius Gracchus, was nominated as the Democratic
 21465	candidate for President. The South and West had triumphed over the East.
 21466	The division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of
 21467	power which Calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century
 21468	earlier. The Gold Democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to
 21469	all. A few, unable to endure the thought of voting the Republican
 21470	ticket, held a convention at Indianapolis where, with the sanction of
 21471	Cleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold
 21472	standard in a forlorn hope.
 21473	
 21474	=The Democratic Platform.=--It was to the call from Chicago that the
 21475	Democrats gave heed and the Republicans made answer. The platform on
 21476	which Mr. Bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in
 21477	its language and its appeal. It denounced the practice of allowing
 21478	national banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the
 21479	ground that it was "in derogation of the Constitution," recalling
 21480	Jackson's famous attack on the Bank in 1832. It declared that tariff
 21481	duties should be laid "for the purpose of revenue"--Calhoun's doctrine.
 21482	In demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice
 21483	abandoned in 1873. The income tax came next on the program. The platform
 21484	alleged that the law of 1894, passed by a Democratic Congress, was "in
 21485	strict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court for
 21486	nearly a hundred years," and then hinted that the decision annulling the
 21487	law might be reversed by the same body "as it may hereafter be
 21488	constituted."
 21489	
 21490	The appeal to labor voiced by Mr. Bryan in his "crown of thorns" speech
 21491	was reinforced in the platform. "As labor creates the wealth of the
 21492	country," ran one plank, "we demand the passage of such laws as may be
 21493	necessary to protect it in all its rights." Referring to the recent
 21494	Pullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the
 21495	platform denounced "arbitrary interference by federal authorities in
 21496	local affairs as a violation of the Constitution of the United States
 21497	and a crime against free institutions." A special objection was lodged
 21498	against "government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of
 21499	oppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states
 21500	and rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and
 21501	executioners." The remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by
 21502	jury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. Having made this
 21503	declaration of faith, the Democrats, with Mr. Bryan at the head, raised
 21504	their standard of battle.
 21505	
 21506	=The Heated Campaign.=--The campaign which ensued outrivaled in the
 21507	range of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all
 21508	other political conflicts in American history, not excepting the fateful
 21509	struggle of 1860. Immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of
 21510	both parties. Railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously
 21511	to the Republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same
 21512	anxiety, supported the Democrats. The country was flooded with
 21513	pamphlets, posters, and handbills. Every public forum, from the great
 21514	auditoriums of the cities to the "red schoolhouses" on the countryside,
 21515	was occupied by the opposing forces.
 21516	
 21517	Mr. Bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in
 21518	special trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open
 21519	air. Mr. McKinley chose the older and more formal plan. He received
 21520	delegations at his home in Canton and discussed the issues of the
 21521	campaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized
 21522	orators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. Parades,
 21523	processions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.
 21524	Whole states were polled in advance by the Republicans and the doubtful
 21525	voters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.
 21526	Manufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public
 21527	credit, announced that they would close their doors if the Democrats won
 21528	the election. Men were dismissed from public and private places on
 21529	account of their political views, one eminent college president being
 21530	forced out for advocating free silver. The language employed by
 21531	impassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a
 21532	state of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in
 21533	personal and political abuse.
 21534	
 21535	=The Republican Victory.=--The verdict of the nation was decisive.
 21536	McKinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular
 21537	votes as against Bryan's 6,509,000. The congressional elections were
 21538	equally positive although, on account of the composition of the Senate,
 21539	the "hold-over" Democrats and Populists still enjoyed a power out of
 21540	proportion to their strength as measured at the polls. Even as it was,
 21541	the Republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the
 21542	entire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the
 21543	second half of Mr. Taft's administration, when they lost possession of
 21544	the House of Representatives. The yoke of indecision was broken. The
 21545	party of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of
 21546	power with untroubled assurance.
 21547	
 21548	
 21549	REPUBLICAN MEASURES AND RESULTS
 21550	
 21551	=The Gold Standard and the Tariff.=--Yet strange as it may seem, the
 21552	Republicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the
 21553	standard for the national currency. Not until 1900 did they take that
 21554	positive step. In his first inaugural President McKinley, as if still
 21555	uncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just
 21556	closed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.
 21557	"The people have decided," he said, "that such legislation should be had
 21558	as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and
 21559	development of our country." Protection for American industries,
 21560	therefore, he urged, is the task before Congress. "With adequate revenue
 21561	secured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal
 21562	laws." As the Republicans had only forty-six of the ninety Senators, and
 21563	at least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the
 21564	discretion exercised by the President in selecting the tariff for
 21565	congressional debate was the better part of valor.
 21566	
 21567	Congress gave heed to the warning. Under the direction of Nelson P.
 21568	Dingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the
 21569	highest rates yet laid in the history of American imposts was prepared
 21570	and driven through the House of Representatives. The opposition
 21571	encountered in the Senate, especially from the West, was overcome by
 21572	concessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,
 21573	steel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities
 21574	handled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.
 21575

 21577	
 21578	PRESIDENT MCKINLEY AND HIS CABINET]
 21579	
 21580	=Growth of Combinations.=--The years that followed the enactment of the
 21581	Dingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country
 21582	had witnessed for many a decade. Industries of every kind were soon
 21583	running full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly
 21584	than ever to the markets of the world. Coincident with this progress was
 21585	the organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had
 21586	yet seen. In 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of
 21587	$65,000,000; in the same year the Standard Oil Company with a capital of
 21588	over one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the
 21589	Copper Trust was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, its par
 21590	value capital being fixed shortly afterward at $175,000,000. A year
 21591	later the National Sugar Refining Company, of New Jersey, started with a
 21592	capital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the
 21593	stockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.
 21594	Before another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing
 21595	was reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the United States
 21596	Steel Corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an
 21597	enterprise set in motion by the famous Morgan banking house of New York.
 21598	
 21599	In nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in
 21600	finance were more or less intimately associated. To use the language of
 21601	an eminent authority: "They are all allied and intertwined by their
 21602	various mutual interests. For instance, the Pennsylvania Railroad
 21603	interests are on the one hand allied with the Vanderbilts and on the
 21604	other with the Rockefellers. The Vanderbilts are closely allied with the
 21605	Morgan group.... Viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in
 21606	the trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,
 21607	many allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all
 21608	being appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves
 21609	dependent on and allied with the two mammoth or Rockefeller and Morgan
 21610	groups. These two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the
 21611	business and commercial life of the nation." Such was the picture of
 21612	triumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years
 21613	after the memorable campaign of 1896.
 21614	
 21615	America had become one of the first workshops of the world. It was, by
 21616	virtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one
 21617	of the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants
 21618	for the business of the earth. The capital of the Steel Corporation
 21619	alone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles
 21620	of calamity in the days of Washington and Hamilton declared the nation
 21621	could never pay. American industry, filling domestic markets to
 21622	overflowing, was ready for new worlds to conquer.

 21730	CHAPTER XX
 21731	
 21732	AMERICA A WORLD POWER (1865-1900)
 21733	
 21734	
 21735	It has now become a fashion, sanctioned by wide usage and by eminent
 21736	historians, to speak of America, triumphant over Spain and possessed of
 21737	new colonies, as entering the twentieth century in the role of "a world
 21738	power," for the first time. Perhaps at this late day, it is useless to
 21739	protest against the currency of the idea. Nevertheless, the truth is
 21740	that from the fateful moment in March, 1775, when Edmund Burke unfolded
 21741	to his colleagues in the British Parliament the resources of an
 21742	invincible America, down to the settlement at Versailles in 1919 closing
 21743	the drama of the World War, this nation has been a world power,
 21744	influencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,
 21745	and arms the course of international affairs. And it should be said also
 21746	that neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of
 21747	diplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity.
 21748	
 21749	When John Hay, Secretary of State, heard that an American citizen,
 21750	Perdicaris, had been seized by Raisuli, a Moroccan bandit, in 1904, he
 21751	wired his brusque message: "We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead."
 21752	This was but an echo of Commodore Decatur's equally characteristic
 21753	answer, "Not a minute," given nearly a hundred years before to the
 21754	pirates of Algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease
 21755	preying upon American merchantmen. Was it not as early as 1844 that the
 21756	American commissioner, Caleb Cushing, taking advantage of the British
 21757	Opium War on China, negotiated with the Celestial Empire a successful
 21758	commercial treaty? Did he not then exultantly exclaim: "The laws of the
 21759	Union follow its citizens and its banner protects them even within the
 21760	domain of the Chinese Empire"? Was it not almost half a century before
 21761	the battle of Manila Bay in 1898, that Commodore Perry with an adequate
 21762	naval force "gently coerced Japan into friendship with us," leading all
 21763	the nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of
 21764	the Occident? Nor is it inappropriate in this connection to recall the
 21765	fact that the Monroe Doctrine celebrates in 1923 its hundredth
 21766	anniversary.
 21767	
 21768	
 21769	AMERICAN FOREIGN RELATIONS (1865-98)
 21770	
 21771	=French Intrigues in Mexico Blocked.=--Between the war for the union and
 21772	the war with Spain, the Department of State had many an occasion to
 21773	present the rights of America among the powers of the world. Only a
 21774	little while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called
 21775	upon to deal with a dangerous situation created in Mexico by the
 21776	ambitions of Napoleon III. During the administration of Buchanan, Mexico
 21777	had fallen into disorder through the strife of the Liberal and the
 21778	Clerical parties; the President asked for authority to use American
 21779	troops to bring to a peaceful haven "a wreck upon the ocean, drifting
 21780	about as she is impelled by different factions." Our own domestic crisis
 21781	then intervened.
 21782	
 21783	Observing the United States heavily involved in its own problems, the
 21784	great powers, England, France, and Spain, decided in the autumn of 1861
 21785	to take a hand themselves in restoring order in Mexico. They entered
 21786	into an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against Mexico
 21787	and to protect their subjects residing in that republic. They invited
 21788	the United States to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they
 21789	prepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own
 21790	account. In the midst of this action England and Spain, discovering the
 21791	sinister purposes of Napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field
 21792	to him.
 21793	
 21794	The French Emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the
 21795	growth of the United States and dreamed of establishing in the Western
 21796	hemisphere an imperial power to offset the American republic.
 21797	Intervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.
 21798	Throwing off that guise in due time, he made the Archduke Maximilian, a
 21799	brother of the ruler of Austria, emperor in Mexico, and surrounded his
 21800	throne by French soldiers, in spite of all protests.
 21801	
 21802	This insolent attack upon the Mexican republic, deeply resented in the
 21803	United States, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. At that
 21804	juncture General Sheridan was dispatched to the Mexican border with a
 21805	large armed force; General Grant urged the use of the American army to
 21806	expel the French from this continent. The Secretary of State, Seward,
 21807	counseled negotiation first, and, applying the Monroe Doctrine, was able
 21808	to prevail upon Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. Without the support
 21809	of French arms, the sham empire in Mexico collapsed like a house of
 21810	cards and the unhappy Maximilian, the victim of French ambition and
 21811	intrigue, met his death at the hands of a Mexican firing squad.
 21812	
 21813	=Alaska Purchased.=--The Mexican affair had not been brought to a close
 21814	before the Department of State was busy with negotiations which resulted
 21815	in the purchase of Alaska from Russia. The treaty of cession, signed on
 21816	March 30, 1867, added to the United States a domain of nearly six
 21817	hundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than Texas and nearly
 21818	three-fourths the size of the Louisiana purchase. Though it was a
 21819	distant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles
 21820	of water, no question of "imperialism" or "colonization foreign to
 21821	American doctrines" seems to have been raised at the time. The treaty
 21822	was ratified promptly by the Senate. The purchase price, $7,200,000, was
 21823	voted by the House of Representatives after the display of some
 21824	resentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to
 21825	fulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. Seward, who
 21826	formulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept
 21827	Alaska out of the hands of England.
 21828	
 21829	=American Interest in the Caribbean.=--Having achieved this diplomatic
 21830	triumph, Seward turned to the increase of American power in another
 21831	direction. He negotiated, with Denmark, a treaty providing for the
 21832	purchase of the islands of St. John and St. Thomas in the West Indies,
 21833	strategic points in the Caribbean for sea power. This project, long
 21834	afterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this
 21835	occasion by the refusal of the Senate to ratify the treaty. Evidently it
 21836	was not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.
 21837	
 21838	Undaunted by the misadventure in Caribbean policies, President Grant
 21839	warmly advocated the acquisition of Santo Domingo. This little republic
 21840	had long been in a state of general disorder. In 1869 a treaty of
 21841	annexation was concluded with its president. The document Grant
 21842	transmitted to the Senate with his cordial approval, only to have it
 21843	rejected. Not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his
 21844	effort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. Even in his last
 21845	message to Congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved
 21846	the wisdom of his early course. The addition of Santo Domingo to the
 21847	American sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. The
 21848	State Department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.
 21849	
 21850	=The _Alabama_ Claims Arbitrated.=--Indeed, it had in hand a far more
 21851	serious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of Civil War diplomacy. The
 21852	British government, as already pointed out in other connections, had
 21853	permitted Confederate cruisers, including the famous _Alabama_, built in
 21854	British ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the Northern
 21855	states. This action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave
 21856	breach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to American citizens,
 21857	led first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages
 21858	done to American ships and goods. For a long time Great Britain was
 21859	firm. Her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,
 21860	adding somewhat curtly that "he wished to say once for all that Her
 21861	Majesty's government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and
 21862	hoped that they had made their position perfectly clear." Still
 21863	President Grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though
 21864	closed, was barred. Hamilton Fish, his Secretary of State, renewed the
 21865	demand. Finally he secured from the British government in 1871 the
 21866	treaty of Washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the
 21867	_Alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy
 21868	between the two countries.
 21869	
 21870	The tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at Geneva in
 21871	Switzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on
 21872	both sides awarded to the United States the lump sum of $15,500,000 to
 21873	be distributed among the American claimants. The damages thus allowed
 21874	were large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is
 21875	not surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in
 21876	England. Nevertheless, the prompt payment by the British government
 21877	swept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in America. Moreover,
 21878	the spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful
 21879	arbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen
 21880	of a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.
 21881	
 21882	=Samoa.=--If the Senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of
 21883	acquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same
 21884	could not be said of the State Department or naval officers. In 1872
 21885	Commander Meade, of the United States navy, alive to the importance of
 21886	coaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the
 21887	chief of Tutuila, one of the Samoan Islands, far below the equator, in
 21888	the southern Pacific, nearer to Australia than to California. This
 21889	agreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of
 21890	Pago Pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal
 21891	treaty ratified by the Senate.
 21892	
 21893	Such enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of England and
 21894	Germany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. The
 21895	German emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the
 21896	islands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the Samoan
 21897	group. England, aware of the dangers arising from German outposts in the
 21898	southern seas so near to Australia, was not content to stand aside. So
 21899	it happened that all three countries sent battleships to the Samoan
 21900	waters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly
 21901	settlement. If, as is alleged, Germany entertained a notion of
 21902	challenging American sea power then and there, the presence of British
 21903	ships must have dispelled that dream.
 21904	
 21905	The result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three
 21906	powers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. But joint
 21907	control proved unsatisfactory. There was constant friction between the
 21908	Germans and the English. The spheres of authority being vague and open
 21909	to dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.
 21910	England withdrew altogether, leaving to Germany all the islands except
 21911	Tutuila, which was ceded outright to the United States. Thus one of the
 21912	finest harbors in the Pacific, to the intense delight of the American
 21913	navy, passed permanently under American dominion. Another triumph in
 21914	diplomacy was set down to the credit of the State Department.
 21915	
 21916	=Cleveland and the Venezuela Affair.=--In the relations with South
 21917	America, as well as in those with the distant Pacific, the diplomacy of
 21918	the government at Washington was put to the test. For some time it had
 21919	been watching a dispute between England and Venezuela over the western
 21920	boundary of British Guiana and, on an appeal from Venezuela, it had
 21921	taken a lively interest in the contest. In 1895 President Cleveland saw
 21922	that Great Britain would yield none of her claims. After hearing the
 21923	arguments of Venezuela, his Secretary of State, Richard T. Olney, in a
 21924	note none too conciliatory, asked the British government whether it was
 21925	willing to arbitrate the points in controversy. This inquiry he
 21926	accompanied by a warning to the effect that the United States could not
 21927	permit any European power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.
 21928	"The United States," said the Secretary, "is practically sovereign on
 21929	this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it
 21930	confines its interposition.... Its infinite resources, combined with its
 21931	isolated position, render it master of the situation and practically
 21932	invulnerable against any or all other powers."
 21933	
 21934	The reply evoked from the British government by this strong statement
 21935	was firm and clear. The Monroe Doctrine, it said, even if not so widely
 21936	stretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the
 21937	dispute with Venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties
 21938	involved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. This response
 21939	called forth President Cleveland's startling message of 1895. He asked
 21940	Congress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches
 21941	the true boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. He added that it
 21942	would be the duty of this country "to resist by every means in its
 21943	power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the
 21944	appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of
 21945	governmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,
 21946	we have determined of right belongs to Venezuela." The serious character
 21947	of this statement he thoroughly understood. He declared that he was
 21948	conscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was
 21949	to be deplored, was not comparable to "a supine submission to wrong and
 21950	injustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor."
 21951	
 21952	[Illustration: GROVER CLEVELAND]
 21953	
 21954	The note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill
 21955	cries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a
 21956	portent of war. Responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an
 21957	armed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. Congress created the
 21958	commission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of
 21959	learned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting
 21960	boundary claims. The British government, deaf to the clamor of the
 21961	bellicose section of the London press, deplored the incident,
 21962	courteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in
 21963	the search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the
 21964	issue be submitted to arbitration. The outcome of this somewhat perilous
 21965	dispute contributed not a little to Cleveland's reputation as "a
 21966	sterling representative of the true American spirit." This was not
 21967	diminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that Great Britain was
 21968	on the whole right in her territorial claims against Venezuela.
 21969	
 21970	=The Annexation of Hawaii.=--While engaged in the dangerous Venezuela
 21971	controversy, President Cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in
 21972	events to consider the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in the
 21973	mid-Pacific. For more than half a century American missionaries had been
 21974	active in converting the natives to the Christian faith and enterprising
 21975	American business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.
 21976	Both the Department of State and the Navy Department were fully
 21977	conscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea
 21978	power and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them
 21979	under some other Dominion.
 21980	
 21981	The country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a
 21982	revolution, headed by Americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of
 21983	the native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the
 21984	retirement of Queen Liliuokalani to private life. This crisis, a
 21985	repetition of the Texas affair in a small theater, was immediately
 21986	followed by a demand from the new Hawaiian government for annexation to
 21987	the United States. President Harrison looked with favor on the proposal,
 21988	negotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the Senate for
 21989	approval. There it still rested when his term of office was brought to a
 21990	close.
 21991	
 21992	Harrison's successor, Cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the
 21993	propriety of American action in Hawaii. For the purpose of making an
 21994	inquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.
 21995	On the basis of the report of his agent, Cleveland came to the
 21996	conclusion that "the revolution in the island kingdom had been
 21997	accomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the United
 21998	States and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the
 21999	queen to her throne." Such being his matured conviction, though the
 22000	facts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do
 22001	nothing but withdraw the treaty from the Senate and close the incident.
 22002	
 22003	To the Republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,
 22004	carried out in a way that impugned the motives of a Republican
 22005	President, was nothing less than "a betrayal of American interests." In
 22006	their platform of 1896 they made clear their position: "Our foreign
 22007	policy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our
 22008	interests in the Western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The
 22009	Hawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States and no
 22010	foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them." There was no
 22011	mistaking this view of the issue. As the vote in the election gave
 22012	popular sanction to Republican policies, Congress by a joint resolution,
 22013	passed on July 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the United States and
 22014	later conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.
 22015	
 22016	
 22017	CUBA AND THE SPANISH WAR
 22018	
 22019	=Early American Relations with Cuba.=--The year that brought Hawaii
 22020	finally under the American flag likewise drew to a conclusion another
 22021	long controversy over a similar outpost in the Atlantic, one of the last
 22022	remnants of the once glorious Spanish empire--the island of Cuba.
 22023	
 22024	For a century the Department of State had kept an anxious eye upon this
 22025	base of power, knowing full well that both France and England, already
 22026	well established in the West Indies, had their attention also fixed upon
 22027	Cuba. In the administration of President Fillmore they had united in
 22028	proposing to the United States a tripartite treaty guaranteeing Spain in
 22029	her none too certain ownership. This proposal, squarely rejected,
 22030	furnished the occasion for a statement of American policy which stood
 22031	the test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one
 22032	between Spain and the United States alone.
 22033	
 22034	In that long contest in the United States for the balance of power
 22035	between the North and South, leaders in the latter section often thought
 22036	of bringing Cuba into the union to offset the free states. An
 22037	opportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by
 22038	a controversy over the seizure of an American ship by Cuban authorities.
 22039	On that occasion three American ministers abroad, stationed at Madrid,
 22040	Paris, and London respectively, held a conference and issued the
 22041	celebrated "Ostend Manifesto." They united in declaring that Cuba, by
 22042	her geographical position, formed a part of the United States, that
 22043	possession by a foreign power was inimical to American interests, and
 22044	that an effort should be made to purchase the island from Spain. In case
 22045	the owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, "by
 22046	every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from
 22047	Spain if we possess the power." This startling proclamation to the world
 22048	was promptly disowned by the United States government.
 22049	
 22050	[Illustration: _=An old cartoon.=_

 22052	A SIGHT TOO BAD
 22053	
 22054	_Struggling Cuba._ "You must be awfully near-sighted, Mr. President, not
 22055	to recognize me." _U.S.G._ "No, I am far-sighted: for I can recognize
 22056	France."]
 22057	
 22058	=Revolutions in Cuba.=--For nearly twenty years afterwards the Cuban
 22059	question rested. Then it was revived in another form during President
 22060	Grant's administrations, when the natives became engaged in a
 22061	destructive revolt against Spanish officials. For ten years--1868-78--a
 22062	guerrilla warfare raged in the island. American citizens, by virtue of
 22063	their ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war
 22064	for independence and self-government. Expeditions to help the insurgents
 22065	were fitted out secretly in American ports. Arms and supplies were
 22066	smuggled into Cuba. American soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. The
 22067	enforcement of neutrality against the friends of Cuban independence, no
 22068	pleasing task for a sympathetic President, the protection of American
 22069	lives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept
 22070	our government busy with Cuba for a whole decade.
 22071	
 22072	A brief lull in Cuban disorders was followed in 1895 by a renewal of the
 22073	revolutionary movement. The contest between the rebels and the Spanish
 22074	troops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and
 22075	property, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old
 22076	questions that had tormented Grant's administration. Gomez, the leader
 22077	of the revolt, intent upon provoking American interference, laid waste
 22078	the land with fire and sword. By a proclamation of November 6, 1895, he
 22079	ordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and
 22080	the closure of all sugar factories. The work of ruin was completed by
 22081	the ruthless Spanish general, Weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants
 22082	from rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds
 22083	of disease and starvation. Stories of the atrocities, bad enough in
 22084	simple form, became lurid when transmuted into American news and deeply
 22085	moved the sympathies of the American people. Sermons were preached about
 22086	Spanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the Cubans be sustained "in
 22087	their heroic struggle for independence"; newspapers, scouting the
 22088	ordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded
 22089	intervention and war if necessary.
 22090

 22093	CUBAN REVOLUTIONISTS]
 22094	
 22095	=President Cleveland's Policy.=--Cleveland chose the way of peace. He
 22096	ordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. He declined to act on
 22097	a resolution of Congress in favor of giving to the Cubans the rights of
 22098	belligerents. Anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he
 22099	tendered to Spain the good offices of the United States as mediator in
 22100	the contest--a tender rejected by the Spanish government with the broad
 22101	hint that President Cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop
 22102	to the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the
 22103	insurgents by American sympathizers. Thereupon the President returned to
 22104	the course he had marked out for himself, leaving "the public nuisance"
 22105	to his successor, President McKinley.
 22106	
 22107	=Republican Policies.=--The Republicans in 1897 found themselves in a
 22108	position to employ that "firm, vigorous, and dignified" foreign policy
 22109	which they had approved in their platform. They had declared: "The
 22110	government of Spain having lost control of Cuba and being unable to
 22111	
 22112	protect the property or lives of resident American citizens or to comply
 22113	with its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the
 22114	United States should actively use its influence and good offices to
 22115	restore peace and give independence to the island." The American
 22116	property in Cuba to which the Republicans referred in their platform
 22117	amounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce
 22118	with the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the
 22119	claims of American citizens against Spain for property destroyed totaled
 22120	sixteen millions. To the pleas of humanity which made such an effective
 22121	appeal to the hearts of the American people, there were thus added
 22122	practical considerations of great weight.
 22123	
 22124	=President McKinley Negotiates.=--In the face of the swelling tide of
 22125	popular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,
 22126	McKinley chose first the way of diplomacy. A short time after his
 22127	inauguration he lodged with the Spanish government a dignified protest
 22128	against its policies in Cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry
 22129	with the suave ministers at Madrid. The results of the exchange of
 22130	notes were the recall of the obnoxious General Weyler, the appointment
 22131	of a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the
 22132	policy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a
 22133	promise of "home rule" for Cuba. There is no doubt that the Spanish
 22134	government was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. The
 22135	American minister at Madrid, General Woodford, was convinced that firm
 22136	and patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of Cuba
 22137	by the Spanish government.
 22138	
 22139	=The De Lome and the _Maine_ Incidents.=--Such a policy was defeated by
 22140	events. In February, 1898, a private letter written by Senor de Lome,
 22141	the Spanish ambassador at Washington, expressing contempt for the
 22142	President of the United States, was filched from the mails and passed
 22143	into the hands of a journalist, William R. Hearst, who published it to
 22144	the world. In the excited state of American opinion, few gave heed to
 22145	the grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open
 22146	private correspondence. The Spanish government was compelled to recall
 22147	De Lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.
 22148	
 22149	At this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the
 22150	two negotiating countries in dire peril. On February 15, the battleship
 22151	_Maine_, riding in the harbor of Havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying
 22152	to death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the
 22153	crew. This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence
 22154	of Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.
 22155	When, on March 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated
 22156	ship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off
 22157	some of the ship's magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. If
 22158	any one was inclined to be indifferent to the Cuban war for
 22159	independence, he was now met by the vehement cry: "Remember the
 22160	_Maine_!"
 22161	
 22162	=Spanish Concessions.=--Still the State Department, under McKinley's
 22163	steady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, Spain proving more pliable
 22164	and more ready with promises of reform in the island. Early in April,
 22165	however, there came a decided change in the tenor of American diplomacy.
 22166	On the 4th, McKinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean
 22167	performances, instructed our minister at Madrid to warn the Spanish
 22168	government that as no effective armistice had been offered to the
 22169	Cubans, he would lay the whole matter before Congress. This decision,
 22170	every one knew, from the temper of Congress, meant war--a prospect which
 22171	excited all the European powers. The Pope took an active interest in the
 22172	crisis. France and Germany, foreseeing from long experience in world
 22173	politics an increase of American power and prestige through war, sought
 22174	to prevent it. Spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last
 22175	dispatched to the President a note promising to suspend hostilities, to
 22176	call a Cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be
 22177	reasonably asked.
 22178	
 22179	=President McKinley Calls for War.=--For reasons of his own--reasons
 22180	which have never yet been fully explained--McKinley ignored the final
 22181	program of concessions presented by Spain. At the very moment when his
 22182	patient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from
 22183	his course and launched the country into the war by sending to Congress
 22184	his militant message of April 11, 1898. Without making public the last
 22185	note he had received from Spain, he declared that he was brought to the
 22186	end of his effort and the cause was in the hands of Congress. Humanity,
 22187	the protection of American citizens and property, the injuries to
 22188	American commerce and business, the inability of Spain to bring about
 22189	permanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that
 22190	induced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in
 22191	establishing a stable government in Cuba. They were sufficient for a
 22192	public already straining at the leash.
 22193	
 22194	=The Resolution of Congress.=--There was no doubt of the outcome when
 22195	the issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of Congress.
 22196	Resolutions were soon introduced into the House of Representatives
 22197	authorizing the President to employ armed force in securing peace and
 22198	order in the island and "establishing by the free action of the people
 22199	thereof a stable and independent government of their own." To the form
 22200	and spirit of this proposal the Democrats and Populists took exception.
 22201	In the Senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be
 22202	reckoned with by the narrow Republican majority. As the resolution
 22203	finally read, the independence of Cuba was recognized; Spain was called
 22204	upon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the
 22205	President was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry
 22206	the resolutions into effect. Furthermore the United States disclaimed
 22207	"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
 22208	control over said island except for the pacification thereof." Final
 22209	action was taken by Congress on April 19, 1898, and approved by the
 22210	President on the following day.
 22211	
 22212	=War and Victory.=--Startling events then followed in swift succession.
 22213	The navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of Theodore
 22214	Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Department, was ready for the
 22215	trial by battle. On May 1, Commodore Dewey at Manila Bay shattered the
 22216	Spanish fleet, marking the doom of Spanish dominion in the Philippines.
 22217	On July 3, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera, in attempting to
 22218	escape from Havana, was utterly destroyed by American forces under
 22219	Commodore Schley. On July 17, Santiago, invested by American troops
 22220	under General Shafter and shelled by the American ships, gave up the
 22221	struggle. On July 25 General Miles landed in Porto Rico. On August 13,
 22222	General Merritt and Admiral Dewey carried Manila by storm. The war was
 22223	over.
 22224	
 22225	=The Peace Protocol.=--Spain had already taken cognizance of stern
 22226	facts. As early as July 26, 1898, acting through the French ambassador,
 22227	M. Cambon, the Madrid government approached President McKinley for a
 22228	statement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.
 22229	After some skirmishing Spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. On
 22230	August 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that
 22231	Cuba should be free, Porto Rico ceded to the United States, and Manila
 22232	occupied by American troops pending the formal treaty of peace. On
 22233	October 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at Paris to bring
 22234	about the final settlement.
 22235	
 22236	=Peace Negotiations.=--When the day for the first session of the
 22237	conference arrived, the government at Washington apparently had not made
 22238	up its mind on the final disposition of the Philippines. Perhaps, before
 22239	the battle of Manila Bay, not ten thousand people in the United States
 22240	knew or cared where the Philippines were. Certainly there was in the
 22241	autumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the
 22242	fruits of Dewey's victory. President McKinley doubtless voiced the
 22243	sentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the
 22244	eve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of
 22245	conquest in the Pacific.
 22246	
 22247	The march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.
 22248	"Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines," he said, "is the
 22249	commercial opportunity to which American statesmanship cannot be
 22250	indifferent. It is just to use every legitimate means for the
 22251	enlargement of American trade." On this ground he directed the
 22252	commissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of
 22253	Luzon, the chief of the Philippine group, with its harbor of Manila. It
 22254	was not until the latter part of October that he definitely instructed
 22255	them to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation
 22256	of Luzon alone could not be justified "on political, commercial, or
 22257	humanitarian grounds." This departure from the letter of the peace
 22258	protocol was bitterly resented by the Spanish agents. It was with
 22259	heaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of Spain's
 22260	ancient dominion in the far Pacific.
 22261	
 22262	=The Final Terms of Peace.=--The treaty of peace, as finally agreed
 22263	upon, embraced the following terms: the independence of Cuba; the
 22264	cession of Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States;
 22265	the settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the
 22266	payment of twenty million dollars to Spain by the United States for the
 22267	Philippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of
 22268	the ceded territories by Congress. The great decision had been made. Its
 22269	issue was in the hands of the Senate where the Democrats and the
 22270	Populists held the balance of power under the requirement of the
 22271	two-thirds vote for ratification.
 22272	
 22273	=The Contest in America over the Treaty of Peace.=--The publication of
 22274	the treaty committing the United States to the administration of distant
 22275	colonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct
 22276	channels: support of the policy and opposition to it. The trend in
 22277	Republican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,
 22278	now came into the open. Perhaps a majority of the men highest in the
 22279	councils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in
 22280	the letters of John Hay, Secretary of State. In August of 1898 he had
 22281	hinted, in a friendly letter to Andrew Carnegie, that he sympathized
 22282	with the latter's opposition to "imperialism"; but he had added quickly:
 22283	"The only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to
 22284	withdraw from the Philippines." In November of the same year he wrote to
 22285	Whitelaw Reid, one of the peace commissioners at Paris: "There is a wild
 22286	and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole
 22287	Philippine transaction. Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his
 22288	head.... But all this confusion of tongues will go its way. The country
 22289	will applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in
 22290	the role of conquering heroes with your 'brows bound with oak.'"
 22291	
 22292	Senator Beveridge of Indiana and Senator Platt of Connecticut, accepting
 22293	the verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for
 22294	unquestioning support of the administration in its final step. "Every
 22295	expansion of our territory," said the latter, "has been in accordance
 22296	with the irresistible law of growth. We could no more resist the
 22297	successive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation
 22298	on earth than a tree can resist its growth. The history of territorial
 22299	expansion is the history of our nation's progress and glory. It is a
 22300	matter to be proud of, not to lament. We should rejoice that Providence
 22301	has given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,
 22302	and our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than
 22303	contrive how we can thwart its designs."
 22304	
 22305	This doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of McKinley's policy,
 22306	many a stanch Republican joining with the majority of Democrats in
 22307	denouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.
 22308	Senator Vest introduced in the Senate a resolution that "under the
 22309	Constitution of the United States, no power is given to the federal
 22310	Government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as
 22311	colonies." Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long and honorable
 22312	career gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole
 22313	procedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into
 22314	rivalry with European nations as a colonial power was fraught with
 22315	genuine danger. "Our imperialistic friends," he said, "seem to have
 22316	forgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. They talk about giving
 22317	good government. 'We shall give them such a government as we think they
 22318	are fitted for.' 'We shall give them a better government than they had
 22319	before.' Why, Mr. President, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a
 22320	free people the most stinging of insults. In that little phrase, as in a
 22321	seed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.
 22322	Government is not a gift. Free government is not to be given by all the
 22323	blended powers of earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs, as
 22324	our fathers said, and as their children said, as Jefferson said, and as
 22325	President McKinley said, to human nature itself."
 22326	
 22327	The Senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the
 22328	House of Representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring
 22329	campaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. The
 22330	Democrats and Populists were especially recalcitrant. Mr. Bryan hurried
 22331	to Washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of
 22332	speedy action. Patriotism required ratification, it was said in one
 22333	quarter. The country desires peace and the Senate ought not to delay, it
 22334	was urged in another. Finally, on February 6, 1899, the requisite
 22335	majority of two-thirds was mustered, many a Senator who voted for the
 22336	treaty, however, sharing the misgivings of Senator Hoar as to the
 22337	"dangers of imperialism." Indeed at the time, the Senators passed a
 22338	resolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the Philippines
 22339	was still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the
 22340	possibility of retracing their steps.
 22341	
 22342	=The Attitude of England.=--The Spanish war, while accomplishing the
 22343	simple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all
 22344	other wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. In the first place, it
 22345	exercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among European
 22346	powers. In England, sympathy with the United States was from the first
 22347	positive and outspoken. "The state of feeling here," wrote Mr. Hay, then
 22348	ambassador in London, "is the best I have ever known. From every quarter
 22349	the evidences of it come to me. The royal family by habit and tradition
 22350	are most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even
 22351	among them I find nothing but hearty kindness and--so far as is
 22352	consistent with propriety--sympathy. Among the political leaders on both
 22353	sides I find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that 'the
 22354	other fellows' shall not seem more friendly."
 22355	
 22356	Joseph Chamberlain, the distinguished Liberal statesman, thinking no
 22357	doubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the
 22358	very opening of the war that the next duty of Englishmen "is to
 22359	establish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across
 22360	the Atlantic.... I even go so far as to say that, terrible as war may
 22361	be, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,
 22362	the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack should wave together over an
 22363	Anglo-Saxon alliance." To the American ambassador he added
 22364	significantly that he did not "care a hang what they say about it on the
 22365	continent," which was another way of expressing the hope that the
 22366	warning to Germany and France was sufficient. This friendly English
 22367	opinion, so useful to the United States when a combination of powers to
 22368	support Spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the
 22369	consequences of the war. Henry Adams, recalling days of humiliation in
 22370	London during the Civil War, when his father was the American
 22371	ambassador, coolly remarked that it was "the sudden appearance of
 22372	Germany as the grizzly terror" that "frightened England into America's
 22373	arms"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph
 22374	of American arms was none the less appreciated in Washington where,
 22375	despite outward calm, fears of European complications were never absent.
 22376	
 22377	
 22378	AMERICAN POLICIES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THE ORIENT
 22379	
 22380	=The Filipino Revolt against American Rule.=--In the sphere of domestic
 22381	politics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of
 22382	the Spanish war exercised a marked influence. It introduced at once
 22383	problems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade
 22384	relations with the outlying dominions. These were furthermore
 22385	complicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection
 22386	against American sovereignty in the Philippines. The leader of the
 22387	revolt, Aguinaldo, had been invited to join the American forces in
 22388	overthrowing Spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without
 22389	warrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.
 22390	When the news reached him that the American flag had been substituted
 22391	for the Spanish flag, his resentment was keen. In February, 1899, there
 22392	occurred a slight collision between his men and some American soldiers.
 22393	The conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally
 22394	dwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and
 22395	costing heavily in men and money. Atrocities were committed by the
 22396	native insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;
 22397	it was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare
 22398	were without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. In vain
 22399	did McKinley assure the Filipinos that the institutions and laws
 22400	established in the islands would be designed "not for our satisfaction
 22401	or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,
 22402	peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands." Nothing
 22403	short of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to
 22404	terms.
 22405	
 22406	=Attacks on Republican "Imperialism."=--The Filipino insurrection,
 22407	following so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with Spain,
 22408	moved the American opponents of McKinley's colonial policies to redouble
 22409	their denunciation of what they were pleased to call "imperialism."
 22410	Senator Hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new
 22411	course. The revolt against American rule did but convince him of the
 22412	folly hidden in the first fateful measures. Everywhere he saw a
 22413	conspiracy of silence and injustice. "I have failed to discover in the
 22414	speeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war," he contended
 22415	in the Senate, "or in the press which supports it and them, a single
 22416	expression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the
 22417	Philippine Islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the
 22418	United States the truth of the case.... The catchwords, the cries, the
 22419	pithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full, all mean
 22420	dominion. They mean perpetual dominion.... There is not one of these
 22421	gentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a
 22422	Filipino he would not do exactly as the Filipinos are doing; that he
 22423	would not despise them if they were to do otherwise. So much at least
 22424	they owe of respect to the dead and buried history--the dead and buried
 22425	history so far as they can slay and bury it--of their country." In the
 22426	way of practical suggestions, the Senator offered as a solution of the
 22427	problem: the recognition of independence, assistance in establishing
 22428	self-government, and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee
 22429	of freedom to the islands.
 22430	
 22431	=The Republican Answer.=--To McKinley and his supporters, engaged in a
 22432	sanguinary struggle to maintain American supremacy, such talk was more
 22433	than quixotic; it was scarcely short of treasonable. They pointed out
 22434	the practical obstacles in the way of uniform self-government for a
 22435	collection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most
 22436	ignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of Manila. The
 22437	incidents of the revolt and its repression, they admitted, were painful
 22438	enough; but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow
 22439	the attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to
 22440	set up and sustain democratic institutions. They preferred rather the
 22441	gradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for
 22442	self-government. This course, in their eyes, though less poetic, was
 22443	more in harmony with the ideals of humanity. Having set out upon it,
 22444	they pursued it steadfastly to the end. First, they applied force
 22445	without stint to the suppression of the revolt. Then they devoted such
 22446	genius for colonial administration as they could command to the
 22447	development of civil government, commerce, and industry.

 22451	A PHILIPPINE HOME]
 22452	
 22453	=The Boxer Rebellion in China.=--For a nation with a world-wide trade,
 22454	steadily growing, as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal
 22455	for new markets, isolation was obviously impossible. Never was this
 22456	clearer than in 1900 when a native revolt against foreigners in China,
 22457	known as the Boxer uprising, compelled the United States to join with
 22458	the powers of Europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic
 22459	settlement. The Boxers, a Chinese association, had for some time carried
 22460	on a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the Celestial empire,
 22461	calling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the
 22462	foreigners who, they said, "were lacerating China like tigers." In the
 22463	summer of 1900 the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty. Missionaries
 22464	and traders were murdered in the provinces; foreign legations were
 22465	stoned; the German ambassador, one of the most cordially despised
 22466	foreigners, was killed in the streets of Peking; and to all appearances
 22467	a frightful war of extermination had begun. In the month of June nearly
 22468	five hundred men, women, and children, representing all nations, were
 22469	besieged in the British quarters in Peking under constant fire of
 22470	Chinese guns and in peril of a terrible death.
 22471	
 22472	=Intervention in China.=--Nothing but the arrival of armed forces, made
 22473	up of Japanese, Russian, British, American, French, and German soldiers
 22474	and marines, prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens. When
 22475	once the foreign troops were in possession of the Chinese capital,
 22476	diplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose. For more than
 22477	half a century, the imperial powers of Europe had been carving up the
 22478	Chinese empire, taking to themselves territory, railway concessions,
 22479	mining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the expense of the
 22480	huge but helpless victim. The United States alone among the great
 22481	nations, while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade, had
 22482	refrained from seizing Chinese territory or ports. Moreover, the
 22483	Department of State had been urging European countries to treat China
 22484	with fairness, to respect her territorial integrity, and to give her
 22485	equal trading privileges with all nations.
 22486	
 22487	=The American Policy of the "Open Door."=--In the autumn of 1899,
 22488	Secretary Hay had addressed to London, Berlin, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and
 22489	St. Petersburg his famous note on the "open door" policy in China. In
 22490	this document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested
 22491	interests of the several foreign countries should be respected; that
 22492	the Chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all
 22493	ports held by alien powers except the few free ports; and that there
 22494	should be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the
 22495	citizens of foreign countries operating in the empire. To these
 22496	principles the governments addressed by Mr. Hay, finally acceded with
 22497	evident reluctance.
 22498	
 22499	[Illustration: AMERICAN DOMINIONS IN THE PACIFIC]
 22500	
 22501	On this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the
 22502	Boxer uprising. "The policy of the Government of the United States," he
 22503	said to the great powers, in the summer of 1900, "is to seek a solution
 22504	which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve
 22505	Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights
 22506	guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and
 22507	safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with
 22508	all parts of the Chinese empire." This was a friendly warning to the
 22509	world that the United States would not join in a scramble to punish the
 22510	Chinese by carving out more territory. "The moment we acted," said Mr.
 22511	Hay, "the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground;
 22512	and the German government, which is generally brutal but seldom silly,
 22513	recovered its senses, and climbed down off its perch."
 22514	
 22515	In taking this position, the Secretary of State did but reflect the
 22516	common sense of America. "We are, of course," he explained, "opposed to
 22517	the dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public
 22518	opinion of the United States would justify this government in taking
 22519	part in the great game of spoliation now going on." Heavy damages were
 22520	collected by the European powers from China for the injuries inflicted
 22521	upon their citizens by the Boxers; but the United States, finding the
 22522	sum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims, returned the balance in
 22523	the form of a fund to be applied to the education of Chinese students in
 22524	American universities. "I would rather be, I think," said Mr. Hay, "the
 22525	dupe of China than the chum of the Kaiser." By pursuing a liberal
 22526	policy, he strengthened the hold of the United States upon the
 22527	affections of the Chinese people and, in the long run, as he remarked
 22528	himself, safeguarded "our great commercial interests in that Empire."
 22529	
 22530	=Imperialism in the Presidential Campaign of 1900.=--It is not strange
 22531	that the policy pursued by the Republican administration in disposing of
 22532	the questions raised by the Spanish War became one of the first issues
 22533	in the presidential campaign of 1900. Anticipating attacks from every
 22534	quarter, the Republicans, in renominating McKinley, set forth their
 22535	position in clear and ringing phrases: "In accepting by the treaty of
 22536	Paris the just responsibility of our victories in the Spanish War the
 22537	President and Senate won the undoubted approval of the American people.
 22538	No other course was possible than to destroy Spain's sovereignty
 22539	throughout the West Indies and in the Philippine Islands. That course
 22540	created our responsibility, before the world and with the unorganized
 22541	population whom our intervention had freed from Spain, to provide for
 22542	the maintenance of law and order, and for the establishment of good
 22543	government and for the performance of international obligations. Our
 22544	authority could not be less than our responsibility, and wherever
 22545	sovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government
 22546	to maintain its authority, to put down armed insurrection, and to confer
 22547	the blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples.
 22548	The largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and
 22549	our duties shall be secured to them by law." To give more strength to
 22550	their ticket, the Republican convention, in a whirlwind of enthusiasm,
 22551	nominated for the vice presidency, against his protest, Theodore
 22552	Roosevelt, the governor of New York and the hero of the Rough Riders, so
 22553	popular on account of their Cuban campaign.
 22554	
 22555	The Democrats, as expected, picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such
 22556	defiance by the Republicans. Mr. Bryan, whom they selected as their
 22557	candidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,
 22558	both of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the "imperialistic
 22559	program" of the Republican administration. The Democrats denounced the
 22560	treatment of Cuba and Porto Rico and condemned the Philippine policy in
 22561	sharp and vigorous terms. "As we are not willing," ran the platform, "to
 22562	surrender our civilization or to convert the Republic into an empire, we
 22563	favor an immediate declaration of the Nation's purpose to give to the
 22564	Filipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;
 22565	third, protection from outside interference.... The greedy commercialism
 22566	which dictated the Philippine policy of the Republican administration
 22567	attempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay, but even this
 22568	sordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. The
 22569	war of 'criminal aggression' against the Filipinos entailing an annual
 22570	expense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit
 22571	that could accrue from the entire Philippine trade for years to come....
 22572	We oppose militarism. It means conquest abroad and intimidation and
 22573	oppression at home. It means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to
 22574	free institutions. It is what millions of our citizens have fled from in
 22575	Europe. It will impose upon our peace-loving people a large standing
 22576	army, an unnecessary burden of taxation, and would be a constant menace
 22577	to their liberties." Such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters.
 22578	
 22579	With the issues clearly joined, the country rejected the Democratic
 22580	candidate even more positively than four years before. The popular vote
 22581	cast for McKinley was larger and that cast for Bryan smaller than in the
 22582	silver election. Thus vindicated at the polls, McKinley turned with
 22583	renewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far
 22584	advanced. But fate cut short his designs. In the September following his
 22585	second inauguration, he was shot by an anarchist while attending the
 22586	Buffalo exposition. "What a strange and tragic fate it has been of
 22587	mine," wrote the Secretary of State, John Hay, on the day of the
 22588	President's death, "to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends,
 22589	Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen
 22590	to the head of the state and all done to death by assassins." On
 22591	September 14, 1901, the Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, took up the
 22592	lines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished
 22593	chief, promising to continue "absolutely unbroken" the policies he had
 22594	inherited.
 22595	
 22596	
 22597	SUMMARY OF NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS
 22598	
 22599	The economic aspects of the period between 1865 and 1900 may be readily
 22600	summed up: the recovery of the South from the ruin of the Civil War, the
 22601	extension of the railways, the development of the Great West, and the
 22602	triumph of industry and business enterprise. In the South many of the
 22603	great plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were
 22604	diversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social
 22605	importance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,
 22606	timber, and other resources were brought into use. In the West the free
 22607	arable land was practically exhausted by 1890 under the terms of the
 22608	Homestead Act; gold, silver, copper, coal and other minerals were
 22609	discovered in abundance; numerous rail connections were formed with the
 22610	Atlantic seaboard; the cowboy and the Indian were swept away before a
 22611	standardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs. By the end of
 22612	the century the American frontier had disappeared. The wild, primitive
 22613	life so long associated with America was gone. The unity of the nation
 22614	was established.
 22615	
 22616	In the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. The
 22617	industrial system, which had risen and flourished before the Civil War,
 22618	grew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from
 22619	the Northeast into all parts of the country. Small business concerns
 22620	were transformed into huge corporations. Individual plants were merged
 22621	under the management of gigantic trusts. Short railway lines were
 22622	consolidated into national systems. The industrial population of
 22623	wage-earners rose into the tens of millions. The immigration of aliens
 22624	increased by leaps and bounds. The cities overshadowed the country. The
 22625	nation that had once depended upon Europe for most of its manufactured
 22626	goods became a competitor of Europe in the markets of the earth.
 22627	
 22628	In the sphere of politics, the period witnessed the recovery of white
 22629	supremacy in the South; the continued discussion of the old questions,
 22630	such as the currency, the tariff, and national banking; and the
 22631	injection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems. As of old,
 22632	foreign affairs were kept well at the front. Alaska was purchased from
 22633	Russia; attempts were made to extend American influence in the Caribbean
 22634	region; a Samoan island was brought under the flag; and the Hawaiian
 22635	islands were annexed. The Monroe Doctrine was applied with vigor in the
 22636	dispute between Venezuela and Great Britain.
 22637	
 22638	Assistance was given to the Cubans in their revolutionary struggle
 22639	against Spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the
 22640	annexation of Porto Rico and the Philippines. American influence in the
 22641	Pacific and the Orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight
 22642	in world affairs. Thus questions connected with foreign and "imperial"
 22643	policies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof
 22644	of politics. In the direction of affairs, the Republicans took the
 22645	leadership, for they held the presidency during all the years, except
 22646	eight, between 1865 and 1900.

 22750	THE EVOLUTION OF REPUBLICAN POLICIES (1901-13)
 22751	
 22752	
 22753	=The Personality and Early Career of Roosevelt.=--On September 14, 1901,
 22754	when Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office, the presidency passed
 22755	to a new generation and a leader of a new type recalling, if comparisons
 22756	must be made, Andrew Jackson rather than any Republican predecessor.
 22757	Roosevelt was brusque, hearty, restless, and fond of action--"a young
 22758	fellow of infinite dash and originality," as John Hay remarked of him;
 22759	combining the spirit of his old college, Harvard, with the breezy
 22760	freedom of the plains; interested in everything--a new species of game,
 22761	a new book, a diplomatic riddle, or a novel theory of history or
 22762	biology. Though only forty-three years old he was well versed in the art
 22763	of practical politics. Coming upon the political scene in the early
 22764	eighties, he had associated himself with the reformers in the Republican
 22765	party; but he was no Mugwump. From the first he vehemently preached the
 22766	doctrine of party loyalty; if beaten in the convention, he voted the
 22767	straight ticket in the election. For twenty years he adhered to this
 22768	rule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as
 22769	a spokesman of his party. He served in the New York legislature, as head
 22770	of the metropolitan police force, as federal civil service commissioner
 22771	under President Harrison, as assistant secretary of the navy under
 22772	President McKinley, and as governor of the Empire state. Political
 22773	managers of the old school spoke of him as "brilliant but erratic"; they
 22774	soon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action.

 22781	FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 22782	
 22783	=The Panama Canal.=--The most important foreign question confronting
 22784	President Roosevelt on the day of his inauguration, that of the Panama
 22785	Canal, was a heritage from his predecessor. The idea of a water route
 22786	across the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living
 22787	issue after the historic voyage of the battleship _Oregon_ around South
 22788	America during the Spanish War. But before the United States could act
 22789	it had to undo the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, made with Great Britain in
 22790	1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint
 22791	supervision. This was finally effected by the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of
 22792	1901 authorizing the United States to proceed alone, on condition that
 22793	there should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter
 22794	of rates and charges.
 22795	
 22796	This accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal
 22797	should be built. One group in Congress favored the route through
 22798	Nicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that
 22799	location. Another group favored cutting the way through Panama after
 22800	purchasing the rights of the old French company which, under the
 22801	direction of De Lesseps, the hero of the Suez Canal, had made a costly
 22802	failure some twenty years before. After a heated argument over the
 22803	merits of the two plans, preference was given to the Panama route. As
 22804	the isthmus was then a part of Colombia, President Roosevelt proceeded
 22805	to negotiate with the government at Bogota a treaty authorizing the
 22806	United States to cut a canal through its territory. The treaty was
 22807	easily framed, but it was rejected by the Colombian senate, much to the
 22808	President's exasperation. "You could no more make an agreement with the
 22809	Colombian rulers," he exclaimed, "than you could nail jelly to a wall."
 22810	He was spared the necessity by a timely revolution. On November 3, 1903,
 22811	Panama renounced its allegiance to Colombia and three days later the
 22812	United States recognized its independence.
 22813

 22816	DEEPEST EXCAVATED PORTION OF PANAMA CANAL, SHOWING GOLD HILL ON
 22817	RIGHT AND CONTRACTOR'S HILL ON LEFT. JUNE, 1913]
 22818	
 22819	This amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty
 22820	between Panama and the United States in which the latter secured the
 22821	right to construct the long-discussed canal, in return for a guarantee
 22822	of independence and certain cash payments. The rights and property of
 22823	the French concern were then bought, and the final details settled. A
 22824	lock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. Construction by the
 22825	government directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.
 22826	Scientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases
 22827	that had made Panama a plague spot. Finally, in 1904, as the President
 22828	said, "the dirt began to fly." After surmounting formidable
 22829	difficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the American forces in
 22830	1913 joined the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. Nearly eight
 22831	thousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from New York to San
 22832	Francisco. If any were inclined to criticize President Roosevelt for
 22833	the way in which he snapped off negotiations with Colombia and
 22834	recognized the Panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the
 22835	magnificent outcome of the affair. Notwithstanding the treaty with Great
 22836	Britain, Congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor
 22837	of American ships. It was only on the urgent insistence of President
 22838	Wilson that the measure was later repealed.
 22839	
 22840	=The Conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War.=--The applause which greeted
 22841	the President's next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any
 22842	kind. In the winter of 1904 there broke out between Japan and Russia a
 22843	terrible conflict over the division of spoils in Manchuria. The fortunes
 22844	of war were with the agile forces of Nippon. In this struggle, it seems,
 22845	President Roosevelt's sympathies were mainly with the Japanese, although
 22846	he observed the proprieties of neutrality. At all events, Secretary Hay
 22847	wrote in his diary on New Year's Day, 1905, that the President was
 22848	"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit Japan to be robbed a
 22849	second time of her victory," referring to the fact that Japan, ten years
 22850	before, after defeating China on the field of battle, had been forced by
 22851	Russia, Germany, and France to forego the fruits of conquest.
 22852	
 22853	Whatever the President's personal feelings may have been, he was aware
 22854	that Japan, despite her triumphs over Russia, was staggering under a
 22855	heavy burden of debt. At a suggestion from Tokyo, he invited both
 22856	belligerents in the summer of 1905 to join in a peace conference. The
 22857	celerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of European bankers,
 22858	who had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop.
 22859	After some delay, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was chosen as the meeting
 22860	place for the spokesmen of the two warring powers. Roosevelt presided
 22861	over the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity, thoroughly enjoying the
 22862	justly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the world's
 22863	interest. He had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a
 22864	treaty of peace and amity.
 22865	
 22866	=The Monroe Doctrine Applied to Germany.=--Less spectacular than the
 22867	Russo-Japanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic
 22868	passage-at-arms with Germany over the Monroe Doctrine. This clash grew
 22869	out of the inability or unwillingness of the Venezuelan government to
 22870	pay debts due foreign creditors. Having exhausted their patience in
 22871	negotiations, England and Germany, in December 1901, sent battleships to
 22872	establish what they characterized as "a peaceful blockade" of Venezuelan
 22873	ports. Their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;
 22874	there was a possibility that war and the occupation of Venezuelan
 22875	territory might result.
 22876	
 22877	While unwilling to stand between a Latin-American country and its
 22878	creditors, President Roosevelt was determined that debt collecting
 22879	should not be made an excuse for European countries to seize territory.
 22880	He therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of
 22881	England and Italy. Germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take
 22882	the milder course. The President, learning of this refusal, called the
 22883	German ambassador to the White House and informed him in very precise
 22884	terms that, unless the Imperial German Government consented to
 22885	arbitrate, Admiral Dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions
 22886	to prevent Germany from seizing any Venezuelan territory. A week passed
 22887	and no answer came from Berlin. Not baffled, the President again took
 22888	the matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he
 22889	stated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within
 22890	forty-eight hours the Emperor consented to arbitration, American
 22891	battleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for Venezuelan
 22892	waters. The hint was sufficient. The Kaiser accepted the proposal and
 22893	the President, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him
 22894	publicly on "being so stanch an advocate of arbitration." In terms of
 22895	the Monroe Doctrine this action meant that the United States, while not
 22896	denying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the
 22897	part of European powers that might easily lead to the temporary or
 22898	permanent occupation of Latin-American territory.
 22899	
 22900	=The Santo Domingo Affair.=--The same issue was involved in a
 22901	controversy over Santo Domingo which arose in 1904. The Dominican
 22902	republic, like Venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain European
 22903	countries declared that, unless the United States undertook to look
 22904	after the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed
 22905	coercion. What was the United States to do? The danger of having some
 22906	European power strongly intrenched in Santo Domingo was too imminent to
 22907	be denied. President Roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and
 22908	notwithstanding strong opposition in the Senate was able, in 1907, to
 22909	effect a treaty arrangement which placed Dominican finances under
 22910	American supervision.
 22911	
 22912	In the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of
 22913	interesting questions arose. It was pertinently asked whether the
 22914	American navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts
 22915	anywhere in Latin-America. It was suggested also that no sanction should
 22916	be given to the practice among European governments of using armed force
 22917	to collect private claims. Opponents of President Roosevelt's policy,
 22918	and they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters
 22919	should be referred to the Hague Court or to special international
 22920	commissions for arbitration. To this the answer was made that the United
 22921	States could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the
 22922	Monroe Doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. The
 22923	position of the administration was very clearly stated by President
 22924	Roosevelt himself. "The country," he said, "would certainly decline to
 22925	go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;
 22926	on the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to
 22927	take possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an American
 22928	republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a
 22929	temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only
 22930	escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must
 22931	ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as
 22932	possible of a just obligation shall be paid." The Monroe Doctrine was
 22933	negative. It denied to European powers a certain liberty of operation in
 22934	this hemisphere. The positive obligations resulting from its application
 22935	by the United States were points now emphasized and developed.
 22936	
 22937	=The Hague Conference.=--The controversies over Latin-American relations
 22938	and his part in bringing the Russo-Japanese War to a close naturally
 22939	made a deep impression upon Roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction
 22940	of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The subject was
 22941	moreover in the air. As if conscious of impending calamity, the
 22942	statesmen of the Old World, to all outward signs at least, seemed
 22943	searching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly
 22944	trial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. It was
 22945	the Czar, Nicholas II, fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts
 22946	which he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the
 22947	nations in the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. The conference did
 22948	nothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize
 22949	the right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to
 22950	countries at war and did establish a Court at the Hague for the
 22951	arbitration of international disputes.
 22952	
 22953	Encouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, President Roosevelt in
 22954	1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the Czar the honor of
 22955	issuing the call. At this great international assembly, held at the
 22956	Hague in 1907, the representatives of the United States proposed a plan
 22957	for the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international
 22958	dispute. This was rejected with contempt by Germany. Reduction of
 22959	armaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. In
 22960	fact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for
 22961	the conduct of "civilized warfare," casting a somewhat lurid light upon
 22962	the "pacific" intentions of most of the powers assembled.
 22963	
 22964	=The World Tour of the Fleet.=--As if to assure the world then that the
 22965	United States placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace
 22966	conferences, Roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing
 22967	display of American naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen
 22968	battleships on a tour around the globe. On his own authority, he ordered
 22969	the ships to sail out of Hampton Roads and circle the earth by way of
 22970	the Straits of Magellan, San Francisco, Australia, the Philippines,
 22971	China, Japan, and the Suez Canal. This enterprise was not, as some
 22972	critics claimed, a "mere boyish flourish." President Roosevelt knew how
 22973	deep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. He was aware
 22974	that no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without
 22975	force adequate to sustain it. The voyage around the world therefore
 22976	served a double purpose. It interested his own country in the naval
 22977	program of the government, and it reminded other powers that the
 22978	American giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of
 22979	international rivalries.
 22980	
 22981	
 22982	COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION
 22983	
 22984	=A Constitutional Question Settled.=--In colonial administration, as in
 22985	foreign policy, President Roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path
 22986	already marked out. President McKinley had defined the principles that
 22987	were to control the development of Porto Rico and the Philippines. The
 22988	Republican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual
 22989	self-government, and commercial improvement. The only remaining question
 22990	of importance, to use the popular phrase,--"Does the Constitution follow
 22991	the flag?"--had been answered by the Supreme Court of the United States.
 22992	Although it was well known that the Constitution did not contemplate the
 22993	government of dependencies, such as the Philippines and Porto Rico, the
 22994	Court, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for
 22995	Congress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.
 22996	
 22997	=Porto Rico.=--The government of Porto Rico was a relatively simple
 22998	matter. It was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population
 22999	apart from the Spanish upper class. For a time after military occupation
 23000	in 1898, it was administered under military rule. This was succeeded by
 23001	the establishment of civil government under the "organic act" passed by
 23002	Congress in 1900. The law assured to the Porto Ricans American
 23003	protection but withheld American citizenship--a boon finally granted in
 23004	1917. It provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed
 23005	by the President with the approval of the Senate; and for a legislature
 23006	of two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber
 23007	composed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed
 23008	in the same manner. Thus the United States turned back to the provincial
 23009	system maintained by England in Virginia or New York in old colonial
 23010	days. The natives were given a voice in their government and the power
 23011	of initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and
 23012	administration was vested in officers appointed in Washington. Such was
 23013	the plan under which the affairs of Porto Rico were conducted by
 23014	President Roosevelt. It lasted until the new organic act of 1917.
 23015

 23018	A SUGAR MILL, PORTO RICO]
 23019	
 23020	=The Philippines.=--The administration of the Philippines presented far
 23021	more difficult questions. The number of islands, the variety of
 23022	languages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to
 23023	challenge the skill of the government. Moreover, there was raging in
 23024	1901 a stubborn revolt against American authority, which had to be
 23025	faced. Following the lines laid down by President McKinley, the
 23026	evolution of American policy fell into three stages. At first the
 23027	islands were governed directly by the President under his supreme
 23028	military power. In 1901 a civilian commission, headed by William Howard
 23029	Taft, was selected by the President and charged with the government of
 23030	the provinces in which order had been restored. Six years later, under
 23031	the terms of an organic act, passed by Congress in 1902, the third stage
 23032	was reached. The local government passed into the hands of a governor
 23033	and commission, appointed by the President and Senate, and a
 23034	legislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber
 23035	
 23036	composed of the commission. This scheme, like that obtaining in Porto
 23037	Rico, remained intact until a Democratic Congress under President
 23038	Wilson's leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth
 23039	phase by making both houses elective. Thus, by the steady pursuit of a
 23040	liberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it
 23041	encouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the
 23042	Philippine natives for independence.

 23047	
 23048	=Cuban Relations.=--Within the sphere of colonial affairs, Cuba, though
 23049	nominally independent, also presented problems to the government at
 23050	Washington. In the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of
 23051	war on Spain, Congress, unmindful of practical considerations,
 23052	recognized the independence of Cuba and disclaimed "any disposition or
 23053	intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said
 23054	island except for the pacification thereof." In the settlement that
 23055	followed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young
 23056	republic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a
 23057	guiding hand. Before withdrawing American troops from the island,
 23058	Congress, in March, 1901, enacted, and required Cuba to approve, a
 23059	series of restrictions known as the Platt amendment, limiting her power
 23060	to incur indebtedness, securing the right of the United States to
 23061	intervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving
 23062	to the United States coaling stations at certain points to be agreed
 23063	upon. The Cubans made strong protests against what they deemed
 23064	"infringements of their sovereignty"; but finally with good grace
 23065	accepted their fate. Even when in 1906 President Roosevelt landed
 23066	American troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they
 23067	acquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning
 23068	that they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.
 23069	
 23070	
 23071	THE ROOSEVELT DOMESTIC POLICIES
 23072	
 23073	=Social Questions to the Front.=--From the day of his inauguration to
 23074	the close of his service in 1909, President Roosevelt, in messages,
 23075	speeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of
 23076	trusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,
 23077	and kindred themes. Many a subject previously touched upon only by
 23078	representatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a
 23079	careful examination. That he did this with any fixed design or policy in
 23080	mind does not seem to be the case. He admitted himself that when he
 23081	became President he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching
 23082	plan of social betterment. He did have, however, serious convictions on
 23083	general principles. "I was bent upon making the government," he wrote,
 23084	"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the
 23085	United States to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,
 23086	and industrially. I believed with all my heart in real and
 23087	thorough-going democracy and I wished to make the democracy industrial
 23088	as well as political, although I had only partially formulated the
 23089	method I believed we should follow." It is thus evident at least that he
 23090	had departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing
 23091	but a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over
 23092	the distribution of the nation's wealth and resources.
 23093	
 23094	=Roosevelt's View of the Constitution.=--Equally significant was
 23095	Roosevelt's attitude toward the Constitution and the office of
 23096	President. He utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national
 23097	charter. He held that the Constitution "should be treated as the
 23098	greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in
 23099	exercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a
 23100	strait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth." He viewed the
 23101	presidency as he did the Constitution. Strict constructionists of the
 23102	Jeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the
 23103	Republican party, had taken a view that the President could do nothing
 23104	that he was not specifically authorized by the Constitution to do.
 23105	Roosevelt took exactly the opposite position. It was his opinion that it
 23106	was not only the President's right but his duty "to do anything that the
 23107	needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the
 23108	Constitution or the laws." He went on to say that he acted "for the
 23109	common well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was
 23110	necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative
 23111	prohibition."
 23112	
 23113	=The Trusts and Railways.=--To the trust question, Roosevelt devoted
 23114	especial attention. This was unavoidable. By far the larger part of the
 23115	business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from
 23116	partnerships and individual owners. The growth of these gigantic
 23117	aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in American
 23118	industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth
 23119	century. In the conquest of business by trusts and "the resulting
 23120	private fortunes of great magnitude," the Populists and the Democrats
 23121	had seen a grievous danger to the republic. "Plutocracy has taken the
 23122	place of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore
 23123	the tariff and the trusts"--such was the battle cry which had been taken
 23124	up by Bryan and his followers.
 23125	
 23126	President Roosevelt countered vigorously. He rejected the idea that the
 23127	trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any
 23128	kind. He insisted that they were the outcome of "natural economic
 23129	forces": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them
 23130	to avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets
 23131	on a national scale and even international scale calling for vast
 23132	accumulations of capital to carry on such business; (3) the possibility
 23133	of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. In
 23134	the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of American
 23135	industry. Unregulated competition he regarded as "the source of evils
 23136	which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is
 23137	to survive." The notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns
 23138	should be or could be broken up by a decree of law, Roosevelt considered
 23139	absurd.
 23140	
 23141	At the same time he proposed that "evil trusts" should be prevented from
 23142	"wrong-doing of any kind"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for
 23143	making agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who
 23144	dealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin
 23145	competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.
 23146	Accordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their
 23147	regulation by the government. This, he contended, would preserve the
 23148	advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils
 23149	that accompanied it. The railway company he declared to be a public
 23150	servant. "Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike."
 23151	So he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations
 23152	were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let
 23153	or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations
 23154	could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.
 23155	
 23156	=The Labor Question.=--On the labor question, then pressing to the front
 23157	in public interest, President Roosevelt took advanced ground for his
 23158	time. He declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,
 23159	threatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer
 23160	who was able to bargain and wait. This led him, accordingly, to accept
 23161	the principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective
 23162	bargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally
 23163	with capital. While he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated
 23164	violence and destructive doctrines, he held that "the organization of
 23165	labor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and
 23166	is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true
 23167	industrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United
 23168	States." The last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,
 23169	he approved in case negotiations failed to secure "a fair deal."
 23170	
 23171	He thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,
 23172	could not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. The aid
 23173	of the government at many points he believed to be necessary to
 23174	eliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the
 23175	unfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. In his first message
 23176	of 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should
 23177	have certain and ample compensation. From time to time he advocated
 23178	other legislation to obtain what he called "a larger measure of social
 23179	and industrial justice."
 23180	
 23181	=Great Riches and Taxation.=--Even the challenge of the radicals, such
 23182	as the Populists, who alleged that "the toil of millions is boldly
 23183	stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few"--challenges which his
 23184	predecessors did not consider worthy of notice--President Roosevelt
 23185	refused to let pass without an answer. In his first message he denied
 23186	the truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the
 23187	poor were growing poorer. He asserted that, on the contrary, the average
 23188	man, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than
 23189	ever before in the history of our country. That there had been abuses in
 23190	the accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed
 23191	that even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits
 23192	conferred upon the country. Nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to
 23193	the safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities
 23194	of wealth. In 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to
 23195	prevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. The next year, to the
 23196	astonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a
 23197	message to Congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,
 23198	then generally viewed as Populist or Democratic measures. He even took
 23199	the stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more
 23200	equitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity
 23201	among citizens.
 23202	
 23203	
 23204	LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTIVITIES
 23205	
 23206	=Economic Legislation.=--When President Roosevelt turned from the field
 23207	of opinion he found himself in a different sphere. Many of his views
 23208	were too advanced for the members of his party in Congress, and where
 23209	results depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.
 23210	Nevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that
 23211	bore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he
 23212	dominated Congress to the same degree as did some other Presidents. The
 23213	Hepburn Railway Act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;
 23214	it extended the commission's power over oil pipe lines, express
 23215	companies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the
 23216	right to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it
 23217	forbade "midnight tariffs," that is, sudden changes in rates favoring
 23218	certain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting
 23219	goods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper
 23220	use. Two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same
 23221	year, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and
 23222	deleterious foods and drugs. A significant piece of labor legislation
 23223	was an act of the same Congress making interstate railways liable to
 23224	damages for injuries sustained by their employees. When this measure was
 23225	declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court it was reenacted with the
 23226	objectionable clauses removed. A second installment of labor legislation
 23227	was offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees
 23228	engaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.

 23232	THE ROOSEVELT DAM, PHOENIX, ARIZONA]
 23233	
 23234	=Reclamation and Conservation.=--The open country--the deserts, the
 23235	forests, waterways, and the public lands--interested President Roosevelt
 23236	no less than railway and industrial questions. Indeed, in his first
 23237	message to Congress he placed the conservation of natural resources
 23238	among "the most vital internal problems" of the age, and forcibly
 23239	emphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since
 23240	Cleveland's first administration. The suggestion evoked an immediate
 23241	response in Congress. Under the leadership of Senator Newlands, of
 23242	Nevada, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was passed, providing for the
 23243	redemption of the desert areas of the West. The proceeds from the sale
 23244	of public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and
 23245	sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.
 23246	Furthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should
 23247	go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.
 23248	Construction was started immediately under the terms of the law. Within
 23249	seventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a
 23250	million were actually irrigated. In the single year 1918, the crops of
 23251	the irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.
 23252	
 23253	In his first message, also, President Roosevelt urged the transfer of
 23254	all control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of
 23255	Forestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service
 23256	was created. In every direction noteworthy advances were made in the
 23257	administration of the national domain. The science of forestry was
 23258	improved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. Lands in
 23259	the national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.
 23260	Water power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years
 23261	to private companies instead of being sold outright. The area of the
 23262	national forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres
 23263	by presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in
 23264	one year, 1907. The men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the
 23265	public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their
 23266	dissatisfaction. Fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a
 23267	large scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.
 23268	Millions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been
 23269	carelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn
 23270	from sale and held until Congress was prepared to enact laws for the
 23271	disposition of them in the public interest. Prosecutions were
 23272	instituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast
 23273	tracts were recovered for the national domain. An agitation was begun
 23274	which bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson in laws
 23275	reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,
 23276	phosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations
 23277	to develop them under leases for a period of years.
 23278	
 23279	=The Prosecution of the Trusts.=--As an executive, President Roosevelt
 23280	was also a distinct "personality." His discrimination between "good" and
 23281	"bad" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. On his
 23282	initiative, the Northern Securities Company, formed to obtain control of
 23283	certain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the Supreme
 23284	Court. Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company
 23285	and the Standard Oil Company as monopolies in violation of the Sherman
 23286	Anti-Trust law. The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New
 23287	York customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.
 23288	Frauds in the Post-office Department were uncovered and the offenders
 23289	brought to book. In fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of
 23290	"wrong doers" and "malefactors" haled into federal courts.
 23291	
 23292	=The Great Coal Strike.=--The Roosevelt theory that the President could
 23293	do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the
 23294	laws was put to a severe test in 1902. A strike of the anthracite coal
 23295	miners, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.
 23296	Industries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened
 23297	with the appalling menace of a winter without heat. Governors and mayors
 23298	were powerless and appealed for aid. The mine owners rejected the
 23299	demands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points
 23300	in dispute, although John Mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly
 23301	urged it. After observing closely the course affairs, President
 23302	Roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. He
 23303	arranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of
 23304	the mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. He then
 23305	invited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor
 23306	induced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a
 23307	commission which he appointed. Thus, by stepping outside the
 23308	Constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, President
 23309	Roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.
 23310	
 23311	=The Election of 1904.=--The views and measures which he advocated with
 23312	such vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.
 23313	There were rumors of a Republican movement to defeat his nomination in
 23314	1904 and it was said that the "financial and corporation interests" were
 23315	in arms against him. A prominent Republican paper in New York City
 23316	accused him of having "stolen Mr. Bryan's thunder," by harrying the
 23317	trusts and favoring labor unions. When the Republican convention
 23318	assembled in Chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and Roosevelt
 23319	was nominated by acclamation.
 23320	
 23321	This was the signal for a change on the part of Democratic leaders. They
 23322	denounced the President as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided
 23323	to assume the moderate role themselves. They put aside Mr. Bryan and
 23324	selected as their candidate, Judge Alton B. Parker, of New York, a man
 23325	
 23326	who repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative
 23327	vote. The outcome of the reversal was astounding. Judge Parker's vote
 23328	fell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900; of the 476
 23329	electoral votes he received only 140. Roosevelt, in addition to sweeping
 23330	the Republican sections, even invaded Democratic territory, carrying the
 23331	state of Missouri. Thus vindicated at the polls, he became more
 23332	outspoken than ever. His leadership in the party was so widely
 23333	recognized that he virtually selected his own successor.
 23334	
 23335	
 23336	THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT
 23337	
 23338	=The Campaign of 1908.=--Long before the end of his elective term,
 23339	President Roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,
 23340	William Howard Taft, of Ohio, his Secretary of War. To attain this end
 23341	he used every shred of his powerful influence. When the Republican
 23342	convention assembled, Mr. Taft easily won the nomination. Though the
 23343	party platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge
 23344	by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United
 23345	States Senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. President
 23346	Roosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed
 23347	to the country for his election.
 23348	
 23349	The turn in Republican affairs now convinced Mr. Bryan that the signs
 23350	were propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. The disaster
 23351	to Judge Parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a
 23352	conservative policy. With little difficulty, therefore, the veteran
 23353	leader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his
 23354	standard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking
 23355	the tariff, trusts, and monopolies. Supported by a loyal following, he
 23356	entered the lists, only to meet another defeat. Though he polled almost
 23357	a million and a half more votes than did Judge Parker in 1904, the palm
 23358	went to Mr. Taft.
 23359	
 23360	=The Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions.=--At the very beginning of
 23361	his term, President Taft had to face the tariff issue. He had met it in
 23362	the campaign. Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he
 23363	had expressed opinions which were thought to imply a "downward
 23364	revision." The Democrats made much of the implication and the
 23365	Republicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it. Pressure was coming
 23366	from all sides. More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of
 23367	the Dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered
 23368	with the course of time. Evidently the day for revision--at best a
 23369	thankless task--had arrived. Taft accepted the inevitable and called
 23370	Congress in a special session. Until the midsummer of 1909, Republican
 23371	Senators and Representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the
 23372	President making little effort to influence their decisions. When on
 23373	August 5 the Payne-Aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in
 23374	Republican ranks. Powerful Senators from the Middle West had spoken
 23375	angrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. They had
 23376	even broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire
 23377	scheme of tariff revision.
 23378	
 23379	=The Income Tax Amendment.=--The rift in party harmony was widened by
 23380	another serious difference of opinion. During the debate on the tariff
 23381	bill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax
 23382	provision--this in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court in 1895
 23383	declaring it unconstitutional. Conservative men were alarmed by the
 23384	evident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that
 23385	eminent tribunal. At the same time they saw a powerful combination of
 23386	Republicans and Democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of
 23387	taxation to large incomes. In the press of circumstances, a compromise
 23388	was reached. The income tax bill was dropped for the present; but
 23389	Congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, authorizing
 23390	taxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without
 23391	reference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of
 23392	population. The states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was
 23393	proclaimed.
 23394	
 23395	=President Taft's Policies.=--After the enactment of the tariff bill,
 23396	Taft continued to push forward with his legislative program. He
 23397	recommended, and Congress created, a special court of commerce with
 23398	jurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate
 23399	commerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway
 23400	rates fixed and the orders issued by that body. This measure was quickly
 23401	followed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in
 23402	connection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by
 23403	private banks. Two years later, Congress defied the lobby of the express
 23404	companies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,
 23405	thus enabling the American postal service to catch up with that of other
 23406	progressive nations. With a view to improving the business
 23407	administration of the federal government, the President obtained from
 23408	Congress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission
 23409	charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods
 23410	and recommending improved devices and practices. The chief result of
 23411	this investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget
 23412	system, which soon found public backing.
 23413	
 23414	President Taft negotiated with England and France general treaties
 23415	providing for the arbitration of disputes which were "justiciable" in
 23416	character even though they might involve questions of "vital interest
 23417	and national honor." They were coldly received in the Senate and so
 23418	amended that Taft abandoned them altogether. A tariff reciprocity
 23419	agreement with Canada, however, he forced through Congress in the face
 23420	of strong opposition from his own party. After making a serious breach
 23421	in Republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to
 23422	naught by the overthrow of the Liberals in the Canadian elections of
 23423	1911.
 23424	
 23425	=Prosecution of the Trusts.=--The party schism was even enlarged by what
 23426	appeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.
 23427	In two important cases, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the
 23428	Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that
 23429	they violated the Sherman Anti-Trust law. In taking this step Chief
 23430	Justice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to
 23431	combinations which did not "unduly" restrain trade. His remark,
 23432	construed to mean that the Court would not interfere with corporations
 23433	as such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the President
 23434	and the judges.
 23435	
 23436	
 23437	PROGRESSIVE INSURGENCY AND THE ELECTION OF 1912
 23438	
 23439	=Growing Dissensions.=--All in all, Taft's administration from the first
 23440	day had been disturbed by party discord. High words had passed over the
 23441	tariff bill and disgruntled members of Congress could not forget them.
 23442	To differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old
 23443	age. In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young
 23444	"insurgent" Republicans who resented the dominance of the Speaker,
 23445	Joseph G. Cannon, and other members of the "old guard," as they named
 23446	the men of long service and conservative minds. In 1910, the insurgents
 23447	went so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the
 23448	Speaker's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him
 23449	of the power to appoint its members. The storm was brewing. In the
 23450	autumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of
 23451	Representatives and began an open battle with President Taft by
 23452	demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.
 23453	
 23454	=The Rise of the Progressive Republicans.=--Preparatory to the campaign
 23455	of 1912, the dissenters within the Republican party added the prefix
 23456	"Progressive" to their old title and began to organize a movement to
 23457	prevent the renomination of Mr. Taft. As early as January 21, 1911, they
 23458	formed a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La
 23459	Follette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft measures and
 23460	policies. In October they indorsed Mr. La Follette as "the logical
 23461	Republican candidate" and appealed to the party for support. The
 23462	controversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against
 23463	the occupant of the White House.
 23464	
 23465	=Roosevelt in the Field.=--After looking on for a while, ex-President
 23466	Roosevelt took a hand in the fray. Soon after his return in 1910 from a
 23467	hunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe, he made a series of
 23468	addresses in which he formulated a progressive program. In a speech in
 23469	Kansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax
 23470	bearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,
 23471	conservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct
 23472	primary, and the recall of elective officials. In an address before the
 23473	Ohio state constitutional convention in February, 1912, he indorsed the
 23474	initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the "recall
 23475	of judicial decisions." This was a new and radical note in American
 23476	politics. An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people
 23477	at the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge
 23478	who set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of
 23479	social welfare. The Progressive Republicans, impressed by these
 23480	addresses, turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and on February 24,
 23481	induced him to come out openly as a candidate against Taft for the
 23482	Republican nomination.
 23483	
 23484	=The Split in the Republican Party.=--The country then witnessed the
 23485	strange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged
 23486	in a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the
 23487	Republican convention to be held at Chicago. When the convention
 23488	assembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates
 23489	for both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.
 23490	In deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the
 23491	usual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that Taft received a
 23492	safe majority. After a week of negotiation, Roosevelt and his followers
 23493	left the Republican party. Most of his supporters withdrew from the
 23494	convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll
 23495	call. Undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular Republicans went
 23496	on with their work. They renominated Mr. Taft and put forth a platform
 23497	roundly condemning such Progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.
 23498	
 23499	=The Formation of the Progressive Party.=--The action of the Republicans
 23500	in seating the Taft delegates was vigorously denounced by Roosevelt. He
 23501	declared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the
 23502	Republican party; that any candidate named by it would be "the
 23503	beneficiary of a successful fraud"; and that it would be deeply
 23504	discreditable to any man to accept the convention's approval under such
 23505	circumstances. The bitterness of his followers was extreme. On July 8, a
 23506	call went forth for a "Progressive" convention to be held in Chicago on
 23507	August 5. The assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political
 23508	conference. Prominence was given to women delegates, and "politicians"
 23509	were notably absent. Roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering
 23510	hero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his "confession of
 23511	faith." He was nominated by acclamation; Governor Hiram Johnson of
 23512	California was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President.
 23513	The platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct
 23514	primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of
 23515	United States Senators, and the short ballot. It favored a program of
 23516	social legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum
 23517	wages for women. It approved the regulation, rather than the
 23518	dissolution, of the trusts. Like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the
 23519	Progressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their
 23520	distinguished leader.
 23521	
 23522	=Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912.=--With the Republicans
 23523	divided, victory loomed up before the Democrats. Naturally, a terrific
 23524	contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore.
 23525	Champ Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor
 23526	Woodrow Wilson, of New Jersey, were the chief contestants. After tossing
 23527	to and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the
 23528	delegates, powerfully influenced by Mr. Bryan, finally decided in favor
 23529	of the governor. As a professor, a writer on historical and political
 23530	subjects, and the president of Princeton University, Mr. Wilson had
 23531	become widely known in public life. As the governor of New Jersey he had
 23532	attracted the support of the progressives in both parties. With grim
 23533	determination he had "waged war on the bosses," and pushed through the
 23534	legislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public
 23535	utilities, and creating a system of workmen's compensation in
 23536	industries. During the presidential campaign that followed Governor
 23537	Wilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of
 23538	addresses later published under the title of _The New Freedom_. He
 23539	declared that "the government of the United States is at present the
 23540	foster child of the special interests." He proposed to free the country
 23541	by breaking the dominance of "the big bankers, the big manufacturers,
 23542	the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of
 23543	steamship corporations."
 23544	
 23545	In the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the
 23546	electoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the House
 23547	of Representatives, captured the Senate as well. The popular verdict,
 23548	however, indicated a state of confusion in the country. The combined
 23549	Progressive and Republican vote exceeded that of the Democrats by
 23550	1,300,000. The Socialists, with Eugene V. Debs as their candidate again,
 23551	polled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four
 23552	years before. Thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the
 23553	Republicans, after holding the office of President for sixteen years,
 23554	passed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to
 23555	the Democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the
 23556	outstanding figures of the modern age, Woodrow Wilson.

 23657	
 23658	THE SPIRIT OF REFORM IN AMERICA
 23659	
 23660	
 23661	AN AGE OF CRITICISM
 23662	
 23663	=Attacks on Abuses in American Life.=--The crisis precipitated by the
 23664	Progressive uprising was not a sudden and unexpected one. It had been
 23665	long in preparation. The revolt against corruption in politics which
 23666	produced the Liberal Republican outbreak in the seventies and the
 23667	Mugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of
 23668	American political and economic development. From 1880 until his death
 23669	in 1892, George William Curtis, as president of the Civil Service Reform
 23670	Association, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils
 23671	system. James Bryce, an observant English scholar and man of affairs, in
 23672	his great work, _The American Commonwealth_, published in 1888, by
 23673	picturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated
 23674	the cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. Six years later Henry
 23675	D. Lloyd, in a powerful book entitled _Wealth against Commonwealth_,
 23676	attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their
 23677	rivals and bribed public officials. In 1903 Miss Ida Tarbell, an author
 23678	of established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an
 23679	account of the Standard Oil Company, revealing the ruthless methods of
 23680	that corporation in crushing competition. About the same time Lincoln
 23681	Steffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several
 23682	municipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _The
 23683	Shame of the Cities_. The critical spirit appeared in almost every form;
 23684	in weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials
 23685	and news stories, in novels like Churchill's _Coniston_ and Sinclair's
 23686	_The Jungle_. It became so savage and so wanton that the opening years
 23687	of the twentieth century were well named "the age of the muckrakers."
 23688	
 23689	=The Subjects of the Criticism.=--In this outburst of invective, nothing
 23690	was spared. It was charged that each of the political parties had fallen
 23691	into the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to
 23692	managing conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and
 23693	dictating to officials; in return for their "services" they sold offices
 23694	and privileges. It was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained
 23695	away for private benefit street railway and other franchises. It was
 23696	asserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who
 23697	blackmailed employers. Some critics specialized in descriptions of the
 23698	poverty, slums, and misery of great cities. Others took up "frenzied
 23699	finance" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to
 23700	an innocent public. Still others professed to see in the accumulations
 23701	of millionaires the downfall of our republic.
 23702	
 23703	=The Attack on "Invisible Government."=--Some even maintained that the
 23704	control of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister
 23705	minority called "the invisible government." So eminent and conservative
 23706	a statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his great name to
 23707	such an imputation. Speaking of his native state, New York, he said:
 23708	"What is the government of this state? What has it been during the forty
 23709	years of my acquaintance with it? The government of the Constitution?
 23710	Oh, no; not half the time or half way.... From the days of Fenton and
 23711	Conkling and Arthur and Cornell and Platt, from the days of David B.
 23712	Hill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented
 23713	two different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and
 23714	statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they
 23715	call them party bosses. They call the system--I don't coin the
 23716	phrase--the system they call 'invisible government.' For I don't know
 23717	how many years Mr. Conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. The
 23718	governor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and
 23719	secretaries of state and what not did not count. It was what Mr.
 23720	Conkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled
 23721	down. Then Mr. Platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he
 23722	ruled it. It was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was
 23723	Mr. Platt. And the capital was not here [in Albany]; it was at 49
 23724	Broadway; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants. It makes no difference what
 23725	name you give, whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or
 23726	Arthur or Platt or by the names of men now living. The ruler of the
 23727	state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with
 23728	the state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution
 23729	or by law.... The party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no
 23730	one, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one."
 23731	
 23732	=The Nation Aroused.=--With the spirit of criticism came also the spirit
 23733	of reform. The charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but
 23734	there was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part
 23735	of American democracy. President Roosevelt doubtless summed up the
 23736	sentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the
 23737	punishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: "It makes not a particle of
 23738	difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a
 23739	laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a
 23740	leading representative of a labor union. Swindling in stocks, corrupting
 23741	legislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by
 23742	wrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these
 23743	forms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any
 23744	ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery." The time had come, he added,
 23745	to stop "muckraking" and proceed to the constructive work of removing
 23746	the abuses that had grown up.
 23747	
 23748	
 23749	POLITICAL REFORMS
 23750	
 23751	=The Public Service.=--It was a wise comprehension of the needs of
 23752	American democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to
 23753	sustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public
 23754	service. On the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right
 23755	of the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan
 23756	work. The federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by
 23757	establishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not
 23758	on the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive
 23759	examinations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government
 23760	rather than of parties; (3) no assessment of office holders for campaign
 23761	funds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals
 23762	for political reasons. The act itself at first applied to only 14,000
 23763	federal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it
 23764	was extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an
 23765	executive force of approximately 414,000. While gaining steadily at
 23766	Washington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the
 23767	states and cities. By 1920 they were able to report ten states with
 23768	civil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more
 23769	than three hundred municipalities.
 23770	
 23771	In excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a
 23772	sense, engaged in a negative work: that of "keeping the rascals out."
 23773	But there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one
 23774	constructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient
 23775	servants into the places of responsibility. Everywhere on land and sea,
 23776	in town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. They
 23777	were called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;
 23778	to inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and
 23779	operate great public works, such as the Panama and Erie canals; to
 23780	regulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health
 23781	and safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest
 23782	fires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly
 23783	coal gases that assail the miners. In a word, those who labored to
 23784	master the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of
 23785	the government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,
 23786	foresters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.
 23787	
 23788	Keeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of
 23789	finding competent people for all the technical offices. "Now," said the
 23790	reformers, "we must make attractive careers in the government work for
 23791	the best American talent; we must train those applying for admission and
 23792	increase the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see
 23793	to it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the
 23794	top; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as
 23795	it is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of America that
 23796	public welfare requires."
 23797	
 23798	=The Australian Ballot.=--A second line of attack on the political
 23799	machines was made in connection with the ballot. In the early days
 23800	elections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by
 23801	a show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their
 23802	favorite candidates. When this ancient practice was abandoned in favor
 23803	of the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. Each
 23804	party prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing
 23805	the names of its candidates. On election day, these papers were handed
 23806	out to the voters by party workers. Any one could tell from the color of
 23807	the ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the
 23808	folded ballot, just how each man voted. Those who bought votes were sure
 23809	that their purchases were "delivered." Those who intimidated voters
 23810	could know when their intimidation was effective. In this way the party
 23811	ballot strengthened the party machine.
 23812	
 23813	As a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of
 23814	Australia, urged the adoption of the "Australian ballot." That ballot,
 23815	though it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. It was
 23816	official, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it
 23817	contained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out
 23818	only in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. The first state
 23819	to introduce it was Massachusetts. The year was 1888. Before the end of
 23820	the century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.
 23821	The salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating
 23822	and bribery in elections was beyond all question.
 23823	
 23824	=The Direct Primary.=--In connection with the uprising against machine
 23825	politics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating
 23826	candidates by conventions. These time-honored party assemblies, which
 23827	had come down from the days of Andrew Jackson, were, it was said, merely
 23828	conclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and
 23829	dominated by an inner circle of bosses. The remedy offered in this case
 23830	was again "more democracy," namely, the abolition of the party
 23831	convention and the adoption of the direct primary. Candidates were no
 23832	longer to be chosen by secret conferences. Any member of a party was to
 23833	be allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by
 23834	securing signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his
 23835	fellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. In
 23836	this movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin took the lead and his
 23837	state was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for
 23838	state-wide purposes. The idea spread, rapidly in the West, more slowly
 23839	in the East. The public, already angered against "the bosses," grasped
 23840	eagerly at it. Governor Hughes in New York pressed it upon the unwilling
 23841	legislature. State after state accepted it until by 1918 Rhode Island,
 23842	Delaware, Connecticut, and New Mexico were the only states that had not
 23843	bowed to the storm. Still the results were disappointing and at that
 23844	very time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.
 23845	
 23846	=Popular Election of Federal Senators.=--While the movement for direct
 23847	primaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular
 23848	election of Senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to
 23849	victory. Under the original Constitution, it had been expressly provided
 23850	that Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. In
 23851	practice this rule transferred the selection of Senators to secret
 23852	caucuses of party members in the state legislatures. In connection with
 23853	these caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of
 23854	brazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. The Senate was
 23855	called by its detractors "a millionaires' club" and it was looked upon
 23856	as the "citadel of conservatism." The prescription in this case was
 23857	likewise "more democracy"--direct election of Senators by popular vote.
 23858	
 23859	This reform was not a new idea. It had been proposed in Congress as
 23860	early as 1826. President Johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the
 23861	subject of a special message in 1868 Not long afterward it appeared in
 23862	Congress. At last in 1893, the year after the great Populist upheaval,
 23863	the House of Representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote
 23864	incorporated it in an amendment to the federal Constitution. Again and
 23865	again it passed the House; but the Senate itself was obdurate. Able
 23866	Senators leveled their batteries against it. Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts
 23867	declared that it would transfer the seat of power to the "great cities
 23868	and masses of population"; that it would "overthrow the whole scheme of
 23869	the Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution
 23870	as designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the
 23871	people who adopted it."
 23872	
 23873	Failing in the Senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault
 23874	through the states. They induced state legislatures to enact laws
 23875	requiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct
 23876	primary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular
 23877	choice. Nevada took the lead in 1899. Shortly afterward Oregon, by the
 23878	use of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to
 23879	accept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a
 23880	Republican legislature "electing" a Democrat to represent the state in
 23881	the Senate at Washington. By 1910 three-fourths of the states had
 23882	applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators. Men
 23883	selected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of Congress;
 23884	finally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to
 23885	the federal Constitution providing for the popular election of Senators.
 23886	It was quickly ratified by the states. The following year it was
 23887	proclaimed in effect.
 23888	
 23889	=The Initiative and Referendum.=--As a corrective for the evils which
 23890	had grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the
 23891	introduction of a Swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.
 23892	The initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on
 23893	securing a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the
 23894	submission of the measure to the people at an election. If the bill thus
 23895	initiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. The
 23896	referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the
 23897	legislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a
 23898	reference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or
 23899	rejection. These two practices constitute a form of "direct government."
 23900	
 23901	These devices were prescribed "to restore the government to the people."
 23902	The Populists favored them in their platform of 1896. Mr. Bryan, two
 23903	years later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year South
 23904	Dakota adopted them. In 1902 Oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a
 23905	direct legislation amendment to the state constitution. Within ten years
 23906	all the Southwestern, Mountain, and Pacific states, except Texas and
 23907	Wyoming, had followed this example. To the east of the Mississippi,
 23908	however, direct legislation met a chilly reception. By 1920 only five
 23909	states in this section had accepted it: Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,
 23910	Michigan, and Maryland, the last approving the referendum only.
 23911	
 23912	=The Recall.=--Executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,
 23913	had come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they
 23914	should likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. For
 23915	this purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which
 23916	permitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at
 23917	any time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.
 23918	This feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of Los
 23919	Angeles, was extended to state-wide uses in Oregon in 1908. It failed,
 23920	however, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the
 23921	initiative and referendum. At the end of ten years' agitation, only ten
 23922	states, mainly in the West, had adopted it for general purposes, and
 23923	four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. Still it was
 23924	extensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of
 23925	municipal laws and charters.
 23926	
 23927	As a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was
 23928	bitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. It was denounced
 23929	by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as "nothing less than a complete revolution
 23930	in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon
 23931	which that government rests." In his opinion, it promised to break down
 23932	the representative principle and "undermine and overthrow the bulwarks
 23933	of ordered liberty and individual freedom." Mr. Taft shared Mr. Lodge's
 23934	views and spoke of direct government with scorn. "Votes," he exclaimed,
 23935	"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,
 23936	recalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or
 23937	relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity."
 23938	
 23939	=Commission Government for Cities.=--In the restless searching out of
 23940	evils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. City
 23941	government, Mr. Bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in
 23942	America. This sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a
 23943	warning by others. Many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the
 23944	body politic. Chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city
 23945	government so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.
 23946	"Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the
 23947	city government!" was the new cry in municipal reform. So, many city
 23948	councils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several
 23949	cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was
 23950	abolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was
 23951	given the power to appoint all the chief officials. This made the mayor,
 23952	in some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a
 23953	"short ballot" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed
 23954	to apply also to the state government.
 23955	
 23956	A further step in the concentration of authority was taken in Galveston,
 23957	Texas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by
 23958	the devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems
 23959	of reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management
 23960	of city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. They
 23961	abolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in
 23962	five commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was
 23963	assigned to the office of "mayor president." In 1908, the commission
 23964	form of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by Des
 23965	Moines, Iowa. The attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it
 23966	and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. By 1920, more than
 23967	four hundred cities, including Memphis, Spokane, Birmingham, Newark, and
 23968	Buffalo, had adopted it. Still the larger cities like New York and
 23969	Chicago kept their boards of aldermen.
 23970	
 23971	=The City Manager Plan.=--A few years' experience with commission
 23972	government revealed certain patent defects. The division of the work
 23973	among five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and
 23974	irresponsibility. Commissioners were often lacking in the technical
 23975	ability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police
 23976	protection, public health, public works, and public utilities. Some one
 23977	then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the
 23978	business world. In that sphere the stockholders of each corporation
 23979	elect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business
 23980	manager to conduct the affairs of the company. It was suggested that the
 23981	city commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of
 23982	the city administration, should select a manager to do this. The scheme
 23983	was put into effect in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1912. Like the
 23984	commission plan, it became popular. Within eight years more than one
 23985	hundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. Among the larger
 23986	municipalities were Dayton, Springfield (Ohio), Akron, Kalamazoo, and
 23987	Phoenix. It promised to create a new public service profession, that of
 23988	city manager.
 23989	
 23990	
 23991	MEASURES OF ECONOMIC REFORM
 23992	
 23993	=The Spirit of American Reform.=--The purification of the ballot, the
 23994	restriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular
 23995	control over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by
 23996	the reformers to the critics of American institutions. Nor were they the
 23997	most important. In fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,
 23998	but as means to serve a wider purpose. That purpose was the promotion of
 23999	the "general welfare." The concrete objects covered by that broad term
 24000	were many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by
 24001	railway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the
 24002	extension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the
 24003	cities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross
 24004	inequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.
 24005	
 24006	All these things involved the use of the powers of government. Although
 24007	a few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not
 24008	interfere with private business at all, the American people at large
 24009	rejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an
 24010	extreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. Leaders
 24011	representing every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an
 24012	instrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. "We must
 24013	abandon definitely," said Roosevelt, "the _laissez-faire_ theory of
 24014	political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased
 24015	governmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people
 24016	who denounce this as socialistic." This view was shared by Mr. Taft, who
 24017	observed: "Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to
 24018	relieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to
 24019	make reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational
 24020	education." He was quick to add his caution that "there is a line beyond
 24021	which the government cannot go with any good practical results in
 24022	seeking to make men and society better."
 24023	
 24024	=The Regulation of Railways.=--The first attempts to use the government
 24025	in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were
 24026	made by the Northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.
 24027	Charges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into
 24028	Granges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for
 24029	freight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,
 24030	that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. It
 24031	was claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were
 24032	"quasi-public" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to
 24033	government control. Accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads
 24034	under state supervision. In some cases the state legislature fixed the
 24035	maximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases
 24036	commissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an
 24037	investigation. This legislation was at first denounced in the East as
 24038	nothing less than the "confiscation" of the railways in the interest of
 24039	the farmers. Attempts to have the Supreme Court of the United States
 24040	declare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle
 24041	was finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state
 24042	legislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a
 24043	"fair" return on the capital invested.
 24044	
 24045	In a few years the Granger spirit appeared in Congress. An investigation
 24046	revealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against
 24047	shippers and travelers. The result was the interstate commerce act of
 24048	1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission, forbade
 24049	discriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices
 24050	on the part of railways. This measure was loosely enforced and the
 24051	abuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated. A demand
 24052	for stricter control grew louder and louder. Congress was forced to
 24053	heed. In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law, forbidding railways to charge
 24054	rates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers
 24055	and agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon
 24056	shippers who accepted them. Three years later a still more drastic step
 24057	was taken by the passage of the Hepburn act. The Interstate Commerce
 24058	Commission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and
 24059	after a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates
 24060	had been charged by the companies. In effect, the right to fix freight
 24061	and passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the
 24062	railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the
 24063	Interstate Commerce Commission. Thus private property to the value of
 24064	$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern
 24065	and subject to government regulation in the common interest.
 24066	
 24067	=Municipal Utilities.=--Similar problems arose in connection with the
 24068	street railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great
 24069	cities. In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was
 24070	freely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city
 24071	councils. Distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.
 24072	Many grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of
 24073	999 years. The rates charged and services rendered were left largely to
 24074	the will of the companies holding the franchises. Mergers or unions of
 24075	companies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds
 24076	of doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. The connection between
 24077	the utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not
 24078	always in the public interest.
 24079	
 24080	American ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such
 24081	evils. Three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. One group
 24082	proposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state
 24083	regulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under
 24084	public control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved
 24085	by public authority. In some cases state, and in other cases municipal,
 24086	commissions were created to exercise this great power over "quasi-public
 24087	corporations." Wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,
 24088	water works, telephone, and street railway companies under the
 24089	supervision of a single railway commission. Other states followed this
 24090	example rapidly. By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal
 24091	utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.
 24092	
 24093	A second line of reform appeared in the "model franchise" for utility
 24094	corporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the
 24095	Chicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the
 24096	company was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and
 24097	the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired
 24098	to do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no
 24099	franchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.
 24100	
 24101	A third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of
 24102	municipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely
 24103	out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal
 24104	plants in the city itself. This idea was extensively applied to electric
 24105	light and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few
 24106	cities, including San Francisco and Seattle. In New York the subways are
 24107	owned by the city but leased for operation.
 24108	
 24109	=Tenement House Control.=--Among the other pressing problems of the
 24110	cities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. An inquiry
 24111	in New York City made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed
 24112	poverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. The
 24113	immediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing
 24114	in great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the
 24115	sanitary arrangement for all new buildings. An immense improvement
 24116	followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large
 24117	industrial centers. In 1920 New York made a further invasion of the
 24118	rights of landlords by assuring to the public "reasonable rents" for
 24119	flats and apartments.
 24120	
 24121	=Workmen's Compensation.=--No small part of the poverty in cities was
 24122	due to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. Every year the
 24123	number of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.
 24124	Under the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless
 24125	the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. Even in
 24126	that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover
 24127	"damages." In short, although employers insured their buildings and
 24128	machinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed
 24129	their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. The
 24130	injustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally
 24131	recognized. It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for
 24132	injuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument
 24133	was overborne.
 24134	
 24135	[Illustration: AN EAST SIDE STREET IN NEW YORK]
 24136	
 24137	About 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting
 24138	the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. In the first
 24139	place, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain
 24140	amounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident
 24141	occurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful
 24142	negligence. By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. In the
 24143	second place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the
 24144	form of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in
 24145	industries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by
 24146	both. By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.
 24147	
 24148	=Minimum Wages and Mothers' Pensions.=--Another source of poverty,
 24149	especially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid
 24150	for their labor. Report after report showed this. In 1912 Massachusetts
 24151	took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages
 24152	which might be paid to women and children. Oregon, the following year,
 24153	created a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain
 24154	industries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.
 24155	Within a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this
 24156	character. To cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to
 24157	keep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as
 24158	mothers' pensions became popular during the second decade of the
 24159	twentieth century. At the opening of 1913 two states, Colorado and
 24160	Illinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite
 24161	sums to widows with children. Within four years, thirty-five states had
 24162	similar legislation.
 24163	
 24164	=Taxation and Great Fortunes.=--As a part of the campaign waged against
 24165	poverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great
 24166	fortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to
 24167	heirs on the decease of the owners. Roosevelt was an ardent champion of
 24168	this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to
 24169	Congress in 1907. "Such a tax," he said, "would help to preserve a
 24170	measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations
 24171	growing to manhood.... Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out:
 24172	the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not
 24173	equal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect
 24174	and of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at
 24175	least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man
 24176	obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with
 24177	his fellows."
 24178	
 24179	The spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of
 24180	revolution. It called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but
 24181	for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted
 24182	abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public
 24183	welfare.

 24273	
 24274	
 24275	=Women in Public Affairs.=--The social legislation enacted in response
 24276	to the spirit of reform vitally affected women in the home and in
 24277	industry and was promoted by their organizations. Where they did not
 24278	lead, they were affiliated with movements for social improvement. No
 24279	cause escaped their attention; no year passed without widening the range
 24280	of their interests. They served on committees that inquired into the
 24281	problems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to
 24282	advocate remedies for the evils they discovered. By 1912 they were a
 24283	force to be reckoned with in national politics. In nine states complete
 24284	and equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a
 24285	national suffrage amendment was in full swing. On every hand lay
 24286	evidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public
 24287	affairs. This was the culmination of forces that had long been
 24288	operating.
 24289	
 24290	=A New Emphasis in History.=--A movement so deeply affecting important
 24291	interests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record
 24292	of human progress. History often began as a chronicle of kings and
 24293	queens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to
 24294	instruct the classes that appeared in its pages. With the growth of
 24295	commerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and
 24296	diplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.
 24297	After the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the
 24298	transactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages
 24299	of history. In each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered
 24300	in the light of the new age. So it will be with the rise and growth of
 24301	women's political power. The history of their labor, their education,
 24302	their status in society, their influence on the course of events will be
 24303	explored and given its place in the general record.
 24304	
 24305	It will be a history of change. The superior position which women enjoy
 24306	in America to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost
 24307	rightless condition in colonial times. The founders of America brought
 24308	with them the English common law. Under that law, a married woman's
 24309	personal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her
 24310	husband's property; the management of her lands passed into his control.
 24311	Even the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to
 24312	him. Custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in
 24313	town meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.
 24314	Indeed it is a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from
 24315	Massachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to
 24316	the political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made
 24317	nominating speeches, and served on committees. In the contrast between
 24318	these two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women
 24319	since the landing of the Pilgrims. The account of this progress is a
 24320	narrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations
 24321	among them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation
 24322	for the removal of civil and political disabilities. It is in part also
 24323	a narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into
 24324	industry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and
 24325	therewith economic independence.
 24326	
 24327	
 24328	THE RISE OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT
 24329	
 24330	=Protests of Colonial Women.=--The republican spirit which produced
 24331	American independence was of slow and steady growth. It did not spring
 24332	up full-armed in a single night. It was, on the contrary, nourished
 24333	during a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by
 24334	debates in the public forum. Women shared that fireside sifting of
 24335	political principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in
 24336	letters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written
 24337	word. How widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is
 24338	revealed in the collections of women's letters, articles, songs, dramas,
 24339	and satirical "skits" on English rule that have come down to us. In this
 24340	search into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought
 24341	about laws that excluded them from the ballot. Two women at least left
 24342	their protests on record. Abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of John
 24343	Adams, wrote to her husband, in March, 1776, that women objected "to all
 24344	arbitrary power whether of state or males" and demanded political
 24345	privileges in the new order then being created. Hannah Lee Corbin, the
 24346	sister of "Lighthorse" Harry Lee, protested to her brother against the
 24347	taxation of women without representation.
 24348	
 24349	[Illustration: ABIGAIL ADAMS]
 24350	
 24351	=The Stir among European Women.=--Ferment in America, in the case of
 24352	women as of men, was quickened by events in Europe. In 1792, Mary
 24353	Wollstonecraft published in England the _Vindication of the Rights of
 24354	Women_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among
 24355	women as the writings of Locke and Paine had served that of men. The
 24356	specific grievances which stirred English women were men's invasion of
 24357	women's industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal
 24358	educational opportunities; and political disabilities. In France also
 24359	the great Revolution raised questionings about the status of women. The
 24360	rights of "citizenesses" as well as the rights of "citizens" were
 24361	examined by the boldest thinkers. This in turn reacted upon women in the
 24362	United States.
 24363	
 24364	=Leadership in America.=--The origins of the American woman movement are
 24365	to be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. During
 24366	the first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and
 24367	pamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. Lydia
 24368	Maria Child wrote a history of women; Margaret Fuller made a critical
 24369	examination of the status of women in her time; and Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet
 24370	supplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women
 24371	had played in the American Revolution.
 24372	
 24373	=The Struggle for Education.=--Along with criticism, there was carried
 24374	on a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women
 24375	who had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the
 24376	country. In this long battle, Emma Willard and Mary Lyon led the way;
 24377	the former founded a seminary at Troy, New York; and the latter made the
 24378	beginnings of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in
 24379	Ohio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were
 24380	graduated young students to lead in the woman movement. Sarah J. Hale,
 24381	who in 1827 became the editor of a "Ladies' Magazine," published in
 24382	Boston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which
 24383	helped to bear fruit in the founding of Vassar College shortly after the
 24384	Civil War.
 24385	
 24386	=The Desire to Effect Reforms.=--As they came to study their own history
 24387	and their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply
 24388	interested in all the controversies going on around them. The temperance
 24389	question made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the
 24390	right to be heard on it. In 1846 the "Daughters of Temperance" formed a
 24391	secret society favoring prohibition. They dared to criticize the
 24392	churches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that
 24393	drunkenness be made a ground for divorce.
 24394	
 24395	The slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public
 24396	life. The Grimke sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen,
 24397	and one of these sisters, exiled from Charleston for her "Appeal to the
 24398	Christian Women of the South," went North to work against the slavery
 24399	system. In 1837 the National Women's Anti-Slavery Convention met in New
 24400	York; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. Three years
 24401	later eight American women, five of them in Quaker costume, attended the
 24402	World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, much to the horror of the men,
 24403	who promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was
 24404	not fitting for women to take part in such meetings.
 24405	
 24406	In other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily
 24407	enlarged their interest. Nothing human did they consider alien to them.
 24408	They inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. They
 24409	organized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. Dorothea Dix
 24410	directed the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish
 24411	in 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. In the same year
 24412	Sarah G. Bagley organized the Lowell Female Reform Association for the
 24413	purpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding "the
 24414	constitutions of future generations." Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham, matron
 24415	in Sing Sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her
 24416	social work, especially prison reform. Wherever there were misery and
 24417	suffering, women were preparing programs of relief.
 24418	
 24419	=Freedom of Speech for Women.=--In the advancement of their causes, of
 24420	whatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take
 24421	part in open meetings. Here they encountered difficulties. The
 24422	appearance of women on the platform was new and strange. Naturally it
 24423	was widely resented. Antoinette Brown, although she had credentials as a
 24424	delegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New
 24425	York City simply because she was a woman. James Russell Lowell, editor
 24426	of the "Atlantic Monthly," declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the
 24427	theory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought
 24428	that he might consider an article in prose. Nathaniel Hawthorne,
 24429	another editor, even objected to something in prose because to him "all
 24430	ink-stained women were equally detestable." To the natural resentment
 24431	against their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their
 24432	ideas and methods. As temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic
 24433	manner those who would not accept their opinions. As opponents of
 24434	slavery they were especially bitter. One of their conventions, held at
 24435	Philadelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave
 24436	those churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. This
 24437	stirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women
 24438	sit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt
 24439	leniently. Then came the last straw. Women decided that they would
 24440	preach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.
 24441	
 24442	=Women in Industry.=--The period of this ferment was also the age of the
 24443	industrial revolution in America, the rise of the factory system, and
 24444	the growth of mill towns. The labor of women was transferred from the
 24445	homes to the factories. Then arose many questions: the hours of labor,
 24446	the sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign
 24447	immigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those
 24448	of men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. Labor
 24449	organizations sprang up among working women. The mill girls of Lowell,
 24450	Massachusetts, mainly the daughters of New England farmers, published a
 24451	magazine, "The Lowell Offering." So excellent were their writings that
 24452	the French statesman, Thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the
 24453	Chamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a
 24454	republic. As women were now admittedly earning their own way in the
 24455	world by their own labor, they began to talk of their "economic
 24456	independence."
 24457	
 24458	=The World Shaken by Revolution.=--Such was the quickening of women's
 24459	minds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in
 24460	France which spread to Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy.
 24461	Once more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of
 24462	democracy and expound human rights. Women, now better educated and more
 24463	"advanced" in their ideas, played a role of still greater importance in
 24464	that revolution. They led in agitations and uprisings. They suffered
 24465	from reaction and persecution. From their prison in France, two of them
 24466	who had been jailed for too much insistence on women's rights exchanged
 24467	greetings with American women who were raising the same issue here. By
 24468	this time the women had more supporters among the men. Horace Greeley,
 24469	editor of the New York _Tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used
 24470	his powerful pen in their behalf. Anti-slavery leaders welcomed their
 24471	aid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.
 24472	
 24473	=The Woman's Rights Convention of 1848.=--The forces, moral and
 24474	intellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few
 24475	months after the outbreak of the European revolution in the first
 24476	Woman's Rights Convention in the history of America. It met at Seneca
 24477	Falls, New York, in 1848, on the call of Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright,
 24478	Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock, three of them Quakers.
 24479	Accustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the Quakers
 24480	naturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the
 24481	convention. Indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that
 24482	position seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of
 24483	woman's rights.
 24484	
 24485	The deliberations of the Seneca Falls convention resulted in a
 24486	Declaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence. For
 24487	example, the preamble began: "When in the course of human events it
 24488	becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among
 24489	the people of the earth a position different from that which they have
 24490	hitherto occupied...." So also it closed: "Such has been the patient
 24491	suffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity
 24492	which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are
 24493	entitled." Then followed the list of grievances, the same number which
 24494	had been exhibited to George III in 1776. Especially did they assail the
 24495	disabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into
 24496	America--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,
 24497	and their legal existence as separate persons. All these grievances they
 24498	recited to "a candid world." The remedies for the evils which they
 24499	endured were then set forth in detail. They demanded "equal rights" in
 24500	the colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to
 24501	share in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to
 24502	complete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the
 24503	children; and for married women the right to own property, to keep
 24504	wages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the
 24505	courts of justice. In short, they declared women to be persons as men
 24506	are persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human
 24507	beings. Such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in
 24508	1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a
 24509	world fated to heed and obey.
 24510	
 24511	=The First Gains in Civil Liberty.=--The convention of 1848 did not make
 24512	political enfranchisement the leading issue. Rather did it emphasize the
 24513	civil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion
 24514	at the time. Indeed, the New York legislature of that very year, as the
 24515	result of a twelve years' agitation, passed the Married Woman's Property
 24516	Act setting aside the general principles of the English common law as
 24517	applied to women and giving them many of the "rights of man." California
 24518	and Wisconsin followed in 1850; Massachusetts in 1854; and Kansas in
 24519	1859. Other states soon fell into line. Women's earnings and
 24520	inheritances were at last their own in some states at least. In a little
 24521	while laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their
 24522	children and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of
 24523	cruelty and drunkenness.
 24524	
 24525	By degrees other steps were taken. The Woman's Medical College of
 24526	Pennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the Philadelphia School of Design
 24527	for Women three years later. In 1852 the American Women's Educational
 24528	Association was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged
 24529	educational opportunities for women. Other colleges soon emulated the
 24530	example of Oberlin: the University of Utah in 1850; Hillsdale College in
 24531	Michigan in 1855; Baker University in Kansas in 1858; and the University
 24532	of Iowa in 1860. New trades and professions were opened to women and old
 24533	prejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.
 24534	
 24535	
 24536	THE NATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE
 24537	
 24538	=The Beginnings of Organization.=--As women surmounted one obstacle
 24539	after another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. If
 24540	any year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well
 24541	be 1850, when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional
 24542	convention to confer the vote upon them. With apparent spontaneity there
 24543	were held in the same year state suffrage conferences in Indiana,
 24544	Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts; and connections were formed among the
 24545	leaders of these meetings. At the same time the first national suffrage
 24546	convention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the call of
 24547	eighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. Accounts of
 24548	the convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.
 24549	English women,--for instance, Harriet Martineau,--sent words of
 24550	appreciation for the work thus inaugurated. It inspired a leading
 24551	article in the "Westminster Review," which deeply interested the
 24552	distinguished economist, John Stuart Mill. Soon he was the champion of
 24553	woman suffrage in the British Parliament and the author of a powerful
 24554	tract _The Subjection of Women_, widely read throughout the
 24555	English-speaking world. Thus do world movements grow. Strange to relate
 24556	the women of England were enfranchised before the adoption of the
 24557	federal suffrage amendment in America.
 24558	
 24559	The national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an
 24560	extraordinary outburst of agitation. Pamphlets streamed from the press.
 24561	Petitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.
 24562	There were addresses by favorite orators like Garrison, Phillips, and
 24563	Curtis, and lectures and poems by men like Emerson, Longfellow, and
 24564	Whittier. In 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a
 24565	member of Congress from Rhode Island. By this time the last barrier to
 24566	white manhood suffrage in the North had been swept away and the woman's
 24567	movement was gaining momentum every year.
 24568	
 24569	=The Suffrage Movement Checked by the Civil War.=--Advocates of woman
 24570	suffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil
 24571	War engaged the energies and labors of the nation. Northern women became
 24572	absorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. They held no suffrage
 24573	conventions for five years. They transformed their associations into
 24574	Loyalty Leagues. They banded together to buy only domestic goods when
 24575	foreign imports threatened to ruin American markets. They rolled up
 24576	monster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. In hospitals,
 24577	in military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their
 24578	full share of responsibility. Even when the New York legislature took
 24579	advantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the
 24580	mother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,
 24581	they refused to lay aside war work for agitation. As in all other wars,
 24582	their devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the
 24583	necessities of the hour.
 24584	
 24585	=The Federal Suffrage Amendment.=--Their plans and activities, when the
 24586	war closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. The emancipation
 24587	of the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the
 24588	question of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.
 24589	Friends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not
 24590	be safe unless he was granted the right to vote. The woman suffragists
 24591	very pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.
 24592	The answer which they received was negative. The fourteenth amendment to
 24593	the federal Constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by
 24594	limiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was
 24595	concerned, to the male sex. In making manhood suffrage national,
 24596	however, it nationalized the issue.
 24597	
 24598	This was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. In March, 1869,
 24599	their proposed amendment was introduced in Congress by George W. Julian
 24600	of Indiana. It provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote
 24601	on account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment
 24602	which forbade disfranchisement on account of race. Support for the
 24603	amendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe
 24604	that their case was hopeful. In their platform of 1872, for example, the
 24605	Republicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,
 24606	welcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the
 24607	demand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved
 24608	"respectful consideration."
 24609	
 24610	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
 24611	
 24612	SUSAN B. ANTHONY]
 24613	
 24614	Experience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.
 24615	Indeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay
 24616	before them. They had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.
 24617	They gave the name of "The Revolution" to their paper, edited by
 24618	Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. They formed a national
 24619	suffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to Congress to
 24620	present their claims. Such activities bore some results. Many eminent
 24621	congressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their
 24622	colleagues of both chambers. Still the subject was ridiculed by the
 24623	newspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.
 24624	
 24625	=The State Campaigns.=--Discouraged by the outcome of the national
 24626	campaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and
 24627	sought the ballot at their hands. Gains by this process were painfully
 24628	slow. Wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to
 24629	women in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,
 24630	in spite of strong protests in Congress. In 1893 Colorado established
 24631	complete political equality. In Utah, the third suffrage state, the
 24632	cause suffered many vicissitudes. Women were enfranchised by the
 24633	territorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in
 24634	1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the union they
 24635	recovered their former rights. During the same year, 1896, Idaho
 24636	conferred equal suffrage upon the women. This was the last suffrage
 24637	victory for more than a decade.
 24638	
 24639	=The Suffrage Cause in Congress.=--In the midst of the meager gains
 24640	among the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate
 24641	action on the federal amendment. Between 1878 and 1896 the Senate
 24642	committee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on
 24643	five different occasions. During the same period, however, there were
 24644	nine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point
 24645	of a general debate. At no time could anything like the required
 24646	two-thirds vote be obtained.
 24647	
 24648	=The Changing Status of Women.=--While the suffrage movement was
 24649	lagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily
 24650	multiplying. College after college--Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley,
 24651	to mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher
 24652	education. Other institutions, especially the state universities of the
 24653	West, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the
 24654	professions of law and medicine. By the rapid growth of public high
 24655	schools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was
 24656	extended still more widely. The number of women teachers increased by
 24657	leaps and bounds.
 24658	
 24659	Meanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and
 24660	business. How many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we
 24661	do not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the
 24662	census. Between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions
 24663	rose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and
 24664	transportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent; and in manufacturing
 24665	from 13 to 19 per cent. In 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women
 24666	gainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. When, during the war
 24667	on Germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for
 24668	equal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services
 24669	in industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road
 24670	forecast by the leaders of 1848.
 24671	
 24672	=The Club Movement among Women.=--All over the country women's societies
 24673	and clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study
 24674	literature, art, and science. In time these women's organizations of all
 24675	kinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and
 24676	drawn into the consideration of public questions. Under the leadership
 24677	of Frances Willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. They took
 24678	an interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public
 24679	health, and municipal government, among other things. At their sessions
 24680	and conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until
 24681	finally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. By
 24682	solemn resolution in 1914 the National Federation of Women's Clubs,
 24683	representing nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman
 24684	suffrage. In the same year the National Education Association, speaking
 24685	for the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.
 24686	
 24687	=State and National Action.=--Again the suffrage movement was in full
 24688	swing in the states. Washington in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon,
 24689	Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Nevada and Montana in 1914 by popular vote
 24690	enfranchised their women. Illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right
 24691	to vote for President of the United States. The time had arrived for a
 24692	new movement. A number of younger suffragists sought to use the votes of
 24693	women in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national
 24694	political parties to endorse and carry through Congress the federal
 24695	suffrage amendment. Pressure then came upon Congress from every
 24696	direction: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the
 24697	grounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of
 24698	the West to vote against candidates for President, who would not approve
 24699	the federal amendment. In 1916, for the first time, a leading
 24700	presidential candidate, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking for the
 24701	Republicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished
 24702	ex-President, Roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an
 24703	issue in the campaign.

 24708	1920]
 24709	
 24710	=National Enfranchisement.=--After that, events moved rapidly. The great
 24711	state of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917. Oklahoma, South
 24712	Dakota, and Michigan swung into line the following year; several other
 24713	states, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for
 24714	President. In the meantime the suffrage battle at Washington grew
 24715	intense. Appeals and petitions poured in upon Congress and the
 24716	President. Militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in Washington.
 24717	On September 30, 1918, President Wilson, who, two years before, had
 24718	opposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,
 24719	went before Congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to
 24720	the Constitution. In June, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was
 24721	secured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for
 24722	ratification. On August 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, Tennessee,
 24723	approved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required
 24724	by the Constitution. Thus woman suffrage became the law of the land. A
 24725	new political democracy had been created. The age of agitation was
 24726	closed and the epoch of responsible citizenship opened.

 24806	INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
 24807	
 24808	
 24809	=The New Economic Age.=--The spirit of criticism and the measures of
 24810	reform designed to meet it, which characterized the opening years of the
 24811	twentieth century, were merely the signs of a new age. The nation had
 24812	definitely passed into industrialism. The number of city dwellers
 24813	employed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own
 24814	land was steadily mounting. The free land, once the refuge of restless
 24815	workingmen of the East and the immigrants from Europe, was a thing of
 24816	the past. As President Roosevelt later said in speaking of the great
 24817	coal strike, "a few generations ago, the American workman could have
 24818	saved money, gone West, and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands
 24819	were gone. In earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might
 24820	come to own a mine. That outlet was now closed as regards the immense
 24821	majority.... The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,
 24822	if they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by
 24823	ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which
 24824	all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked."
 24825	
 24826	The disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,
 24827	also produced "a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the
 24828	employer and the individual employee standing alone. The great
 24829	coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of
 24830	thousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular
 24831	miner. The miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense
 24832	with the companies. He needed a job; his wife and children would starve
 24833	if he did not get one.... Individually the miners were impotent when
 24834	they sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they
 24835	could make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain
 24836	collectively." It was of this state of affairs that President Taft spoke
 24837	when he favored the modification of the common law "so as to put
 24838	employees of little power and means on a level with their employers in
 24839	adjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations."
 24840	
 24841	John D. Rockefeller, Jr., on the side of the great captains of industry,
 24842	recognized the same facts. He said: "In the early days of the
 24843	development of industry, the employer and capital investor were
 24844	frequently one. Daily contact was had between him and his employees, who
 24845	were his friends and neighbors.... Because of the proportions which
 24846	modern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often
 24847	strangers to each other.... Personal relations can be revived only
 24848	through adequate representation of the employees. Representation is a
 24849	principle which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful
 24850	conduct of industry.... It is not consistent for us as Americans to
 24851	demand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....
 24852	With the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to
 24853	come a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether
 24854	by capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, cooperative control by
 24855	all three."
 24856	
 24857	
 24858	COOPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES
 24859	
 24860	=Company Unions.=--The changed economic life described by the three
 24861	eminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and
 24862	business concerns. All over the country decided efforts were made to
 24863	bridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. Among
 24864	the devices adopted was that of the "company union." In one of the
 24865	Western lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to
 24866	join a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss
 24867	matters of common concern; they elected a "shop committee" to confer
 24868	with the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of
 24869	the employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters
 24870	of mutual interest. The function of the shop committee was to consider
 24871	wages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.
 24872	Whenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman
 24873	and, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the
 24874	shop committee. If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of
 24875	the man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the
 24876	company's agents. All these things failing, the dispute was transferred
 24877	to a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers'
 24878	representatives, in common council. A deadlock, if it ensued from such a
 24879	conference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by
 24880	both sides from among citizens outside the mill. Thus the employees were
 24881	given a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights
 24882	and grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than
 24883	individual concern. Representatives of trade unions from outside,
 24884	however, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers
 24885	and the employees.
 24886	
 24887	=Profit-sharing.=--Another proposal for drawing capital and labor
 24888	together was to supplement the wage system by other ties. Sometimes lump
 24889	sums were paid to employees who remained in a company's service for a
 24890	definite period of years. Again they were given a certain percentage of
 24891	the annual profits. In other instances, employees were allowed to buy
 24892	stock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. This
 24893	last plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that
 24894	the employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect
 24895	representatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the
 24896	entire business. So extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the
 24897	Federal Industrial Relations Committee, appointed by the President,
 24898	deemed it worthy of a special study. Though opposed by regular trade
 24899	unions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.
 24900	
 24901	=Labor Managers and Welfare Work.=--Another effort of employers to meet
 24902	the problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,
 24903	known as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations
 24904	existing between masters and workers and discover practical methods for
 24905	dealing with each grievance as it arose. By 1918, hundreds of big
 24906	companies had recognized this modern "profession" and universities were
 24907	giving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. In
 24908	that year a national conference of employment managers was held at
 24909	Rochester, New York. The discussion revealed a wide range of duties
 24910	assigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,
 24911	rest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind
 24912	designed to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more
 24913	humane. Thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the
 24914	old idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and
 24915	that their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit
 24916	to fix. In short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation
 24917	to take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the
 24918	production of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of
 24919	the producers.
 24920	
 24921	
 24922	THE RISE AND GROWTH OF ORGANIZED LABOR
 24923	
 24924	=The American Federation of Labor.=--Meanwhile a powerful association of
 24925	workers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into
 24926	unions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.
 24927	This was the American Federation of Labor, a nation-wide union of
 24928	unions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years
 24929	before. At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000
 24930	members. Its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total
 24931	enrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. At that point the increase became
 24932	marked. The membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000
 24933	in 1919. To be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several
 24934	strong unions, friendly to the Federation, though not affiliated with
 24935	it. Such, for example, were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half
 24936	a million members. By the opening of 1920 the total strength of
 24937	organized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we
 24938	include their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the
 24939	United States were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of
 24940	trade unions.
 24941	
 24942	=Historical Background.=--This was the culmination of a long and
 24943	significant history. Before the end of the eighteenth century, the
 24944	skilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as
 24945	we have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. Between 1830 and
 24946	1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the American labor
 24947	movement. For one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps
 24948	and bounds in all the industrial towns. For another, there was
 24949	established in every large manufacturing city a central labor body
 24950	composed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. In the
 24951	local union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered
 24952	only their special trade problems. In the central labor union, printers,
 24953	cordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common
 24954	problems and learned to cooperate with one another in enforcing the
 24955	demands of each craft. A third step was the federation of the unions of
 24956	the same craftsmen in different cities. The printers of New York,
 24957	Philadelphia, Boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and
 24958	formed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of
 24959	that craft. By the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful
 24960	national unions of this character. The expansion of the railway made
 24961	travel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even
 24962	for workmen of small means. About 1834 an attempt was made to federate
 24963	the unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but
 24964	the effort was premature.
 24965	
 24966	_The National Labor Union._--The plan which failed in 1834 was tried
 24967	again in the sixties. During the war, industries and railways had
 24968	flourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for
 24969	labor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. Hundreds of
 24970	new local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions
 24971	had sprung into being. The time was ripe, it seemed, for a national
 24972	consolidation of all labor's forces; and in 1866, the year after the
 24973	surrender of General Lee at Appomattox, the "National Labor Union" was
 24974	formed at Baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,
 24975	W.H. Sylvis of the iron molders. The purpose of the National Labor Union
 24976	was not merely to secure labor's standard demands touching hours, wages,
 24977	and conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. It leaned
 24978	toward political action and radical opinions. Above all, it sought to
 24979	eliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen
 24980	the owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries. For
 24981	six years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and
 24982	carry on its propaganda; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed,
 24983	political dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an
 24984	end.
 24985	
 24986	_The Knights of Labor._--While the National Labor Union was
 24987	experimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical
 24988	organization known as the "Noble Order of the Knights of Labor." It was
 24989	founded in Philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,
 24990	signs, and pass words; "so that no spy of the boss can find his way into
 24991	the lodge room to betray his fellows," as the Knights put it. In form
 24992	the new organization was simple. It sought to bring all laborers,
 24993	skilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty
 24994	body of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.
 24995	By 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it
 24996	boasted a membership of over 700,000. In philosophy, the Knights of
 24997	Labor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the
 24998	railways and other utilities and the formation of cooperative societies
 24999	to own and manage stores and factories.
 25000	
 25001	As the Knights were radical in spirit and their strikes, numerous and
 25002	prolonged, were often accompanied by violence, the organization alarmed
 25003	employers and the general public, raising up against itself a vigorous
 25004	opposition. Weaknesses within, as well as foes from without, started the
 25005	Knights on the path to dissolution. They waged more strikes than they
 25006	could carry on successfully; their cooperative experiments failed as
 25007	those of other labor groups before them had failed; and the rank and
 25008	file could not be kept in line. The majority of the members wanted
 25009	immediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours; when their hopes
 25010	were not realized they drifted away from the order. The troubles were
 25011	increased by the appearance of the American Federation of Labor, a still
 25012	mightier organization composed mainly of skilled workers who held
 25013	strategic positions in industry. When they failed to secure the
 25014	effective support of the Federation in their efforts to organize the
 25015	unskilled, the employers closed in upon them; then the Knights declined
 25016	rapidly in power. By 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short
 25017	time they passed into the limbo of dead experiments.
 25018	
 25019	=The Policies of the American Federation.=--Unlike the Knights of Labor,
 25020	the American Federation of Labor sought, first of all, to be very
 25021	practical in its objects and methods. It avoided all kinds of
 25022	socialistic theories and attended strictly to the business of organizing
 25023	unions for the purpose of increasing wages, shortening hours, and
 25024	improving working conditions for its members. It did not try to include
 25025	everybody in one big union but brought together the employees of each
 25026	particular craft whose interests were clearly the same. To prepare for
 25027	strikes and periods of unemployment, it raised large funds by imposing
 25028	heavy dues and created a benefit system to hold men loyally to the
 25029	union. In order to permit action on a national scale, it gave the
 25030	superior officers extensive powers over local unions.
 25031	
 25032	While declaring that employers and employees had much in common, the
 25033	Federation strongly opposed company unions. Employers, it argued, were
 25034	affiliated with the National Manufacturers' Association or with similar
 25035	employers' organizations; every important industry was now national in
 25036	scope; and wages and hours, in view of competition with other shops,
 25037	could not be determined in a single factory, no matter how amicable
 25038	might be the relations of the company and its workers in that particular
 25039	plant. For these reasons, the Federation declared company unions and
 25040	local shop committees inherently weak; it insisted that hours, wages,
 25041	and other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreements
 25042	applicable to all the plants of a given industry, even if subject to
 25043	local modifications.
 25044	
 25045	At the same time, the Federation, far from deliberately antagonizing
 25046	employers, sought to enlist their cooperation and support. It affiliated
 25047	with the National Civic Federation, an association of business men,
 25048	financiers, and professional men, founded in 1900 to promote friendly
 25049	relations in the industrial world. In brief, the American Federation of
 25050	Labor accepted the modern industrial system and, by organization within
 25051	it, endeavored to secure certain definite terms and conditions for trade
 25052	unionists.
 25053	
 25054	
 25055	THE WIDER RELATIONS OF ORGANIZED LABOR
 25056	
 25057	=The Socialists.=--The trade unionism "pure and simple," espoused by the
 25058	American Federation of Labor, seemed to involve at first glance nothing
 25059	but businesslike negotiations with employers. In practice it did not
 25060	work out that way. The Federation was only six years old when a new
 25061	organization, appealing directly for the labor vote--namely, the
 25062	Socialist Labor Party--nominated a candidate for President, launched
 25063	into a national campaign, and called upon trade unionists to desert the
 25064	older parties and enter its fold.
 25065	
 25066	The socialistic idea, introduced into national politics in 1892, had
 25067	been long in germination. Before the Civil War, a number of reformers,
 25068	including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, and Wendell Phillips,
 25069	deeply moved by the poverty of the great industrial cities, had
 25070	earnestly sought relief in the establishment of cooperative or
 25071	communistic colonies. They believed that people should go into the
 25072	country, secure land and tools, own them in common so that no one could
 25073	profit from exclusive ownership, and produce by common labor the food
 25074	and clothing necessary for their support. For a time this movement
 25075	attracted wide interest, but it had little vitality. Nearly all the
 25076	colonies failed. Selfishness and indolence usually disrupted the best of
 25077	them.
 25078	
 25079	In the course of time this "Utopian" idea was abandoned, and another set
 25080	of socialist doctrines, claiming to be more "scientific," appeared
 25081	instead. The new school of socialists, adopting the principles of a
 25082	German writer and agitator, Karl Marx, appealed directly to workingmen.
 25083	It urged them to unite against the capitalists, to get possession of the
 25084	machinery of government, and to introduce collective or public ownership
 25085	of railways, land, mines, mills, and other means of production. The
 25086	Marxian socialists, therefore, became political. They sought to organize
 25087	labor and to win elections. Like the other parties they put forward
 25088	candidates and platforms. The Socialist Labor party in 1892, for
 25089	example, declared in favor of government ownership of utilities, free
 25090	school books, woman suffrage, heavy income taxes, and the referendum.
 25091	The Socialist party, founded in 1900, with Eugene V. Debs, the leader of
 25092	the Pullman strike, as its candidate, called for public ownership of all
 25093	trusts, monopolies, mines, railways; and the chief means of production.
 25094	In the course of time the vote of the latter organization rose to
 25095	considerable proportions, reaching almost a million in 1912. It declined
 25096	four years later and then rose in 1920 to about the same figure.
 25097	
 25098	In their appeal for votes, the socialists of every type turned first to
 25099	labor. At the annual conventions of the American Federation of Labor
 25100	they besought the delegates to endorse socialism. The president of the
 25101	Federation, Samuel Gompers, on each occasion took the floor against
 25102	them. He repudiated socialism and the socialists, on both theoretical
 25103	and practical grounds. He opposed too much public ownership, declaring
 25104	that the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress
 25105	labor. The approval of socialism, he maintained, would split the
 25106	Federation on the rock of politics, weaken it in its fight for higher
 25107	wages and shorter hours, and prejudice the public against it. At every
 25108	turn he was able to vanquish the socialists in the Federation, although
 25109	he could not prevent it from endorsing public ownership of the railways
 25110	at the convention of 1920.
 25111	
 25112	=The Extreme Radicals.=--Some of the socialists, defeated in their
 25113	efforts to capture organized labor and seeing that the gains in
 25114	elections were very meager, broke away from both trade unionism and
 25115	politics. One faction, the Industrial Workers of the World, founded in
 25116	1905, declared themselves opposed to all capitalists, the wages system,
 25117	and craft unions. They asserted that the "working class and the
 25118	employing class have nothing in common" and that trade unions only
 25119	pitted one set of workers against another set. They repudiated all
 25120	government ownership and the government itself, boldly proclaiming their
 25121	intention to unite all employees into one big union and seize the
 25122	railways, mines, and mills of the country. This doctrine, so
 25123	revolutionary in tone, called down upon the extremists the condemnation
 25124	of the American Federation of Labor as well as of the general public. At
 25125	its convention in 1919, the Federation went on record as "opposed to
 25126	Bolshevism, I.W.W.-ism, and the irresponsible leadership that encourages
 25127	such a policy." It announced its "firm adherence to American ideals."
 25128	
 25129	=The Federation and Political Issues.=--The hostility of the Federation
 25130	to the socialists did not mean, however, that it was indifferent to
 25131	political issues or political parties. On the contrary, from time to
 25132	time, at its annual conventions, it endorsed political and social
 25133	reforms, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall, the abolition
 25134	of child labor, the exclusion of Oriental labor, old-age pensions, and
 25135	government ownership. Moreover it adopted the policy of "rewarding
 25136	friends and punishing enemies" by advising members to vote for or
 25137	against candidates according to their stand on the demands of organized
 25138	labor.

 25142	SAMUEL GOMPERS AND OTHER LABOR LEADERS]
 25143	
 25144	This policy was pursued with especial zeal in connection with disputes
 25145	over the use of injunctions in labor controversies. An injunction is a
 25146	bill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do
 25147	or to refrain from doing something. For example, a judge may order a
 25148	trade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to
 25149	continue at work handling goods made by non-union labor; and he may fine
 25150	or imprison those who disobey his injunction, the penalty being
 25151	inflicted for "contempt of court." This ancient legal device came into
 25152	prominence in connection with nation-wide railway strikes in 1877. It
 25153	was applied with increasing frequency after its effective use against
 25154	Eugene V. Debs in the Pullman strike of 1894.
 25155	
 25156	Aroused by the extensive use of the writ, organized labor demanded that
 25157	the power of judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes be limited by
 25158	law. Representatives of the unions sought support from the Democrats and
 25159	the Republicans; they received from the former very specific and cordial
 25160	endorsement. In 1896 the Democratic platform denounced "government by
 25161	injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression." Mr.
 25162	Gompers, while refusing to commit the Federation to Democratic politics,
 25163	privately supported Mr. Bryan. In 1908, he came out openly and boasted
 25164	that eighty per cent of the votes of the Federation had been cast for
 25165	the Democratic candidate. Again in 1912 the same policy was pursued. The
 25166	reward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal law exempting trade unions
 25167	from prosecution as combinations in restraint of trade, limiting the use
 25168	of the injunction in labor disputes, and prescribing trial by jury in
 25169	case of contempt of court. This measure was hailed by Mr. Gompers as the
 25170	"Magna Carta of Labor" and a vindication of his policy. As a matter of
 25171	fact, however, it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions
 25172	against trade unions. Nevertheless Mr. Gompers was unshaken in his
 25173	conviction that organized labor should not attempt to form an
 25174	independent political party or endorse socialist or other radical
 25175	economic theories.
 25176	
 25177	=Organized Labor and the Public.=--Besides its relations to employers,
 25178	radicals within its own ranks, and political questions, the Federation
 25179	had to face responsibilities to the general public. With the passing of
 25180	time these became heavy and grave. While industries were small and
 25181	conflicts were local in character, a strike seldom affected anybody but
 25182	the employer and the employees immediately involved in it. When,
 25183	however, industries and trade unions became organized on a national
 25184	scale and a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or
 25185	railways, the vital interests of all citizens were put in jeopardy.
 25186	Moreover, as increases in wages and reductions in hours often added
 25187	directly to the cost of living, the action of the unions affected the
 25188	well-being of all--the food, clothing, and shelter of the whole people.
 25189	
 25190	For the purpose of meeting the issue raised by this state of affairs, it
 25191	was suggested that employers and employees should lay their disputes
 25192	before commissions of arbitration for decision and settlement. President
 25193	Cleveland, in a message of April 2, 1886, proposed such a method for
 25194	disposing of industrial controversies, and two years later Congress
 25195	enacted a voluntary arbitration law applicable to the railways. The
 25196	principle was extended in 1898 and again in 1913, and under the
 25197	authority of the federal government many contentions in the railway
 25198	world were settled by arbitration.
 25199	
 25200	The success of such legislation induced some students of industrial
 25201	questions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled to
 25202	submit all disputes to official tribunals of arbitration. Kansas
 25203	actually passed such a law in 1920. Congress in the Esch-Cummins railway
 25204	bill of the same year created a federal board of nine members to which
 25205	all railway controversies, not settled by negotiation, must be
 25206	submitted. Strikes, however, were not absolutely forbidden. Generally
 25207	speaking, both employers and employees opposed compulsory adjustments
 25208	without offering any substitute in case voluntary arbitration should not
 25209	be accepted by both parties to a dispute.
 25210	
 25211	
 25212	IMMIGRATION AND AMERICANIZATION
 25213	
 25214	=The Problems of Immigration.=--From its very inception, the American
 25215	Federation of Labor, like the Knights of Labor before it, was confronted
 25216	by numerous questions raised by the ever swelling tide of aliens coming
 25217	to our shores. In its effort to make each trade union all-inclusive, it
 25218	had to wrestle with a score or more languages. When it succeeded in
 25219	thoroughly organizing a craft, it often found its purposes defeated by
 25220	an influx of foreigners ready to work for lower wages and thus undermine
 25221	the foundations of the union.
 25222	
 25223	At the same time, persons outside the labor movement began to be
 25224	apprehensive as they contemplated the undoubted evil, as well as the
 25225	good, that seemed to be associated with the "alien invasion." They saw
 25226	whole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign
 25227	tongues, reading only foreign newspapers, and looking to the Old World
 25228	alone for their ideas and their customs. They witnessed an expanding
 25229	army of total illiterates, men and women who could read and write no
 25230	language at all; while among those aliens who could read few there were
 25231	who knew anything of American history, traditions, and ideals. Official
 25232	reports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army
 25233	during the World War could not read a newspaper or write a letter home.
 25234	Perhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien
 25235	men are in the United States only on a temporary sojourn, solely to make
 25236	money and return home with their savings. These men, willing to work for
 25237	low wages and live in places unfit for human beings, have no stake in
 25238	this country and do not care what becomes of it.
 25239	
 25240	=The Restriction of Immigration.=--In all this there was, strictly
 25241	speaking, no cause for surprise. Since the foundation of our republic
 25242	the policy of the government had been to encourage the coming of the
 25243	alien. For nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by
 25244	Congress, while two important laws positively encouraged it; namely, the
 25245	homestead act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864. Not
 25246	until American workingmen came into open collision with cheap Chinese
 25247	labor on the Pacific Coast did the federal government spread the first
 25248	measure of limitation on the statute books. After the discovery of gold,
 25249	and particularly after the opening of the railway construction era, a
 25250	horde of laborers from China descended upon California. Accustomed to
 25251	starvation wages and indifferent to the conditions of living, they
 25252	threatened to cut the American standard to the point of subsistence. By
 25253	1876 the protest of American labor was loud and long and both the
 25254	Republicans and the Democrats gave heed to it. In 1882 Congress enacted
 25255	a law prohibiting the admission of Chinese laborers to the United States
 25256	for a term of ten years--later extended by legislation. In a little
 25257	while the demand arose for the exclusion of the Japanese as well. In
 25258	this case no exclusion law was passed; but an understanding was reached
 25259	by which Japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing
 25260	them to come to the United States. By act of Congress in 1907 the
 25261	President was empowered to exclude any laborers who, having passports to
 25262	Canada, Hawaii, or Mexico, attempted to enter our country.
 25263	
 25264	These laws and agreements, however, did not remove all grounds for the
 25265	agitation of the subject. They were difficult to enforce and it was
 25266	claimed by residents of the Coast that in spite of federal authority
 25267	Oriental laborers were finding their way into American ports. Moreover,
 25268	several Western states, anxious to preserve the soil for American
 25269	ownership, enacted laws making it impossible for Chinese and Japanese to
 25270	buy land outright; and in other ways they discriminated against
 25271	Orientals. Such proceedings placed the federal government in an
 25272	embarrassing position. By treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to
 25273	Japanese citizens in the United States, and the government at Tokyo
 25274	contended that the state laws just cited violated the terms of the
 25275	international agreement. The Western states were fixed in their
 25276	determination to control Oriental residents; Japan was equally
 25277	persistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her
 25278	citizens. Subjected to pressure on both sides, the federal government
 25279	sought a way out of the deadlock.
 25280	
 25281	Having embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882, Congress readily
 25282	extended it. In that same year it barred paupers, criminals, convicts,
 25283	and the insane. Three years later, mainly owing to the pressure of the
 25284	Knights of Labor, it forbade any person, company, or association to
 25285	import aliens under contract. By an act of 1887, the contract labor
 25286	restriction was made even more severe. In 1903, anarchists were excluded
 25287	and the bureau of immigration was transferred from the Treasury
 25288	Department to the Department of Commerce and Labor, in order to provide
 25289	for a more rigid execution of the law. In 1907 the classes of persons
 25290	denied admission were widened to embrace those suffering from physical
 25291	and mental defects and otherwise unfit for effective citizenship. When
 25292	the Department of Labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the
 25293	law was placed in the hands of the Secretary of Labor, W.B. Wilson, who
 25294	was a former leader in the American Federation of Labor.
 25295	
 25296	=The Literacy Test.=--Still the advocates of restriction were not
 25297	satisfied. Still organized labor protested and demanded more protection
 25298	against the competition of immigrants. In 1917 it won a thirty-year
 25299	battle in the passage of a bill excluding "all aliens over sixteen years
 25300	of age, physically capable of reading, who cannot read the English
 25301	language or some other language or dialect, including Hebrew or
 25302	Yiddish." Even President Wilson could not block it, for a two-thirds
 25303	vote to overcome his veto was mustered in Congress.
 25304	
 25305	This act, while it served to exclude illiterates, made no drastic cut in
 25306	the volume of immigration. Indeed a material reduction was resolutely
 25307	opposed in many quarters. People of certain nationalities already in the
 25308	United States objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen.
 25309	Some Americans of the old stock still held to the idea that the United
 25310	States should continue to be an asylum for "the oppressed of the earth."
 25311	Many employers looked upon an increased labor supply as the means of
 25312	escaping what they called "the domination of trade unions." In the babel
 25313	of countless voices, the discussion of these vital matters went on in
 25314	town and country.
 25315	
 25316	=Americanization.=--Intimately connected with the subject of immigration
 25317	was a call for the "Americanization" of the alien already within our
 25318	gates. The revelation of the illiteracy in the army raised the cry and
 25319	the demand was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders
 25320	among the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship.
 25321	Innumerable programs for assimilating the alien to American life were
 25322	drawn up, and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in
 25323	Washington under the auspices of the Department of the Interior. All
 25324	were agreed that the foreigner should be taught to speak and write the
 25325	language and understand the government of our country. Congress was
 25326	urged to lend aid in this vast undertaking. America, as ex-President
 25327	Roosevelt had said, was to find out "whether it was a nation or a
 25328	boarding-house."

 25412	CHAPTER XXV
 25413	
 25414	PRESIDENT WILSON AND THE WORLD WAR
 25415	
 25416	
 25417	"The welfare, the happiness, the energy, and the spirit of the men and
 25418	women who do the daily work in our mines and factories, on our
 25419	railroads, in our offices and ports of trade, on our farms, and on the
 25420	sea are the underlying necessity of all prosperity." Thus spoke Woodrow
 25421	Wilson during his campaign for election. In this spirit, as President,
 25422	he gave the signal for work by summoning Congress in a special session
 25423	on April 7, 1913. He invited the cooperation of all "forward-looking
 25424	men" and indicated that he would assume the role of leadership. As an
 25425	evidence of his resolve, he appeared before Congress in person to read
 25426	his first message, reviving the old custom of Washington and Adams. Then
 25427	he let it be known that he would not give his party any rest until it
 25428	fulfilled its pledges to the country. When Democratic Senators balked at
 25429	tariff reductions, they were sharply informed that the party had
 25430	plighted its word and that no excuses or delays would be tolerated.
 25431	
 25432	
 25433	DOMESTIC LEGISLATION
 25434	
 25435	=Financial Measures.=--Under this spirited leadership Congress went to
 25436	work, passing first the Underwood tariff act of 1913, which made a
 25437	downward revision in the rates of duty, fixing them on the average about
 25438	twenty-six per cent lower than the figures of 1907. The protective
 25439	principle was retained, but an effort was made to permit a moderate
 25440	element of foreign competition. As a part of the revenue act Congress
 25441	levied a tax on incomes as authorized by the sixteenth amendment to the
 25442	Constitution. The tax which roused such party passions twenty years
 25443	before was now accepted as a matter of course.
 25444	
 25445	Having disposed of the tariff, Congress took up the old and vexatious
 25446	currency question and offered a new solution in the form of the federal
 25447	reserve law of December, 1913. This measure, one of the most interesting
 25448	in the history of federal finance, embraced four leading features. In
 25449	the first place, it continued the prohibition on the issuance of notes
 25450	by state banks and provided for a national currency. In the second
 25451	place, it put the new banking system under the control of a federal
 25452	reserve board composed entirely of government officials. To prevent the
 25453	growth of a "central money power," it provided, in the third place, for
 25454	the creation of twelve federal reserve banks, one in each of twelve
 25455	great districts into which the country is divided. All local national
 25456	banks were required and certain other banks permitted to become members
 25457	of the new system and share in its control. Finally, with a view to
 25458	expanding the currency, a step which the Democrats had long urged upon
 25459	the country, the issuance of paper money, under definite safeguards, was
 25460	authorized.
 25461	
 25462	Mindful of the agricultural interest, ever dear to the heart of
 25463	Jefferson's followers, the Democrats supplemented the reserve law by the
 25464	Farm Loan Act of 1916, creating federal agencies to lend money on farm
 25465	mortgages at moderate rates of interest. Within a year $20,000,000 had
 25466	been lent to farmers, the heaviest borrowing being in nine Western and
 25467	Southern states, with Texas in the lead.
 25468	
 25469	=Anti-trust Legislation.=--The tariff and currency laws were followed by
 25470	three significant measures relative to trusts. Rejecting utterly the
 25471	Progressive doctrine of government regulation, President Wilson
 25472	announced that it was the purpose of the Democrats "to destroy monopoly
 25473	and maintain competition as the only effective instrument of business
 25474	liberty." The first step in this direction, the Clayton Anti-trust Act,
 25475	carried into great detail the Sherman law of 1890 forbidding and
 25476	penalizing combinations in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. In
 25477	every line it revealed a determined effort to tear apart the great
 25478	trusts and to put all business on a competitive basis. Its terms were
 25479	reinforced in the same year by a law creating a Federal Trade Commission
 25480	empowered to inquire into the methods of corporations and lodge
 25481	complaints against concerns "using any unfair method of competition." In
 25482	only one respect was the severity of the Democratic policy relaxed. An
 25483	act of 1918 provided that the Sherman law should not apply to companies
 25484	engaged in export trade, the purpose being to encourage large
 25485	corporations to enter foreign commerce.
 25486	
 25487	The effect of this whole body of anti-trust legislation, in spite of
 25488	much labor on it, remained problematical. Very few combinations were
 25489	dissolved as a result of it. Startling investigations were made into
 25490	alleged abuses on the part of trusts; but it could hardly be said that
 25491	huge business concerns had lost any of their predominance in American
 25492	industry.
 25493	
 25494	=Labor Legislation.=--By no mere coincidence, the Clayton Anti-trust law
 25495	of 1914 made many concessions to organized labor. It declared that "the
 25496	labor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce,"
 25497	and it exempted unions from prosecution as "combinations in restraint of
 25498	trade." It likewise defined and limited the uses which the federal
 25499	courts might make of injunctions in labor disputes and guaranteed trial
 25500	by jury to those guilty of disobedience (see p. 581).
 25501	
 25502	The Clayton law was followed the next year by the Seamen's Act giving
 25503	greater liberty of contract to American sailors and requiring an
 25504	improvement of living conditions on shipboard. This was such a drastic
 25505	law that shipowners declared themselves unable to meet foreign
 25506	competition under its terms, owing to the low labor standards of other
 25507	countries.
 25508	
 25509	Still more extraordinary than the Seamen's Act was the Adamson law of
 25510	1916 fixing a standard eight-hour work-day for trainmen on railroads--a
 25511	measure wrung from Congress under a threat of a great strike by the four
 25512	Railway Brotherhoods. This act, viewed by union leaders as a triumph,
 25513	called forth a bitter denunciation of "trade union domination," but it
 25514	was easier to criticize than to find another solution of the problem.
 25515	
 25516	Three other laws enacted during President Wilson's administration were
 25517	popular in the labor world. One of them provided compensation for
 25518	federal employees injured in the discharge of their duties. Another
 25519	prohibited the labor of children under a certain age in the industries
 25520	of the nation. A third prescribed for coal miners in Alaska an
 25521	eight-hour day and modern safeguards for life and health. There were
 25522	positive proofs that organized labor had obtained a large share of power
 25523	in the councils of the country.
 25524	
 25525	=Federal and State Relations.=--If the interference of the government
 25526	with business and labor represented a departure from the old idea of
 25527	"the less government the better," what can be said of a large body of
 25528	laws affecting the rights of states? The prohibition of child labor
 25529	everywhere was one indication of the new tendency. Mr. Wilson had once
 25530	declared such legislation unconstitutional; the Supreme Court declared
 25531	it unconstitutional; but Congress, undaunted, carried it into effect
 25532	under the guise of a tax on goods made by children below the age limit.
 25533	There were other indications of the drift. Large sums of money were
 25534	appropriated by Congress in 1916 to assist the states in building and
 25535	maintaining highways. The same year the Farm Loan Act projected the
 25536	federal government into the sphere of local money lending. In 1917
 25537	millions of dollars were granted to states in aid of vocational
 25538	education, incidentally imposing uniform standards throughout the
 25539	country. Evidently the government was no longer limited to the duties of
 25540	the policeman.
 25541	
 25542	=The Prohibition Amendment.=--A still more significant form of
 25543	intervention in state affairs was the passage, in December, 1917, of an
 25544	amendment to the federal Constitution establishing national prohibition
 25545	of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages. This
 25546	was the climax of a historical movement extending over half a century.
 25547	In 1872, a National Prohibition party, launched three years before,
 25548	nominated its first presidential candidate and inaugurated a campaign of
 25549	agitation. Though its vote was never large, the cause for which it
 25550	stood found increasing favor among the people. State after state by
 25551	popular referendum abolished the liquor traffic within its borders. By
 25552	1917 at least thirty-two of the forty-eight were "dry." When the federal
 25553	amendment was submitted for approval, the ratification was surprisingly
 25554	swift. In a little more than a year, namely, on January 16, 1919, it was
 25555	proclaimed. Twelve months later the amendment went into effect.
 25556	
 25557	
 25558	COLONIAL AND FOREIGN POLICIES
 25559	
 25560	=The Philippines and Porto Rico.=--Independence for the Philippines and
 25561	larger self-government for Porto Rico had been among the policies of the
 25562	Democratic party since the campaign of 1900. President Wilson in his
 25563	annual messages urged upon Congress more autonomy for the Filipinos and
 25564	a definite promise of final independence. The result was the Jones
 25565	Organic Act for the Philippines passed in 1916. This measure provided
 25566	that the upper as well as the lower house of the Philippine legislature
 25567	should be elected by popular vote, and declared it to be the intention
 25568	of the United States to grant independence "as soon as a stable
 25569	government can be established." This, said President Wilson on signing
 25570	the bill, is "a very satisfactory advance in our policy of extending to
 25571	them self-government and control of their own affairs." The following
 25572	year Congress, yielding to President Wilson's insistence, passed a new
 25573	
 25574	organic act for Porto Rico, making both houses of the legislature
 25575	elective and conferring American citizenship upon the inhabitants of the
 25576	island.
 25577	
 25578	[Illustration: THE CARIBBEAN REGION]
 25579	
 25580	=American Power in the Caribbean.=--While extending more self-government
 25581	to its dominions, the United States enlarged its sphere of influence in
 25582	the Caribbean. The supervision of finances in Santo Domingo, inaugurated
 25583	in Roosevelt's administration, was transformed into a protectorate under
 25584	Wilson. In 1914 dissensions in the republic led to the landing of
 25585	American marines to "supervise" the elections. Two years later, an
 25586	officer in the American navy, with authority from Washington, placed
 25587	the entire republic "in a state of military occupation." He proceeded to
 25588	suspend the government and laws of the country, exile the president,
 25589	suppress the congress, and substitute American military authority. In
 25590	1919 a consulting board of four prominent Dominicans was appointed to
 25591	aid the American military governor; but it resigned the next year after
 25592	making a plea for the restoration of independence to the republic. For
 25593	all practical purposes, it seemed, the sovereignty of Santo Domingo had
 25594	been transferred to the United States.
 25595	
 25596	In the neighboring republic of Haiti, a similar state of affairs
 25597	existed. In the summer of 1915 a revolution broke out there--one of a
 25598	long series beginning in 1804--and our marines were landed to restore
 25599	order. Elections were held under the supervision of American officers,
 25600	and a treaty was drawn up placing the management of Haitian finances and
 25601	the local constabulary under American authority. In taking this action,
 25602	our Secretary of State was careful to announce: "The United States
 25603	government has no purpose of aggression and is entirely disinterested in
 25604	promoting this protectorate." Still it must be said that there were
 25605	vigorous protests on the part of natives and American citizens against
 25606	the conduct of our agents in the island. In 1921 President Wilson was
 25607	considering withdrawal.
 25608	
 25609	In line with American policy in the West Indian waters was the purchase
 25610	in 1917 of the Danish Islands just off the coast of Porto Rico. The
 25611	strategic position of the islands, especially in relation to Haiti and
 25612	Porto Rico, made them an object of American concern as early as 1867,
 25613	when a treaty of purchase was negotiated only to be rejected by the
 25614	Senate of the United States. In 1902 a second arrangement was made, but
 25615	this time it was defeated by the upper house of the Danish parliament.
 25616	The third treaty brought an end to fifty years of bargaining and the
 25617	Stars and Stripes were raised over St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and
 25618	numerous minor islands scattered about in the neighborhood. "It would be
 25619	suicidal," commented a New York newspaper, "for America, on the
 25620	threshold of a great commercial expansion in South America, to suffer a
 25621	Heligoland, or a Gibraltar, or an Aden to be erected by her rivals at
 25622	the mouth of her Suez." On the mainland American power was strengthened
 25623	by the establishment of a protectorate over Nicaragua in 1916.
 25624	
 25625	=Mexican Relations.=--The extension of American enterprise southward
 25626	into Latin America, of which the operations in the Caribbean regions
 25627	were merely one phase, naturally carried Americans into Mexico to
 25628	develop the natural resources of that country. Under the iron rule of
 25629	General Porfirio Diaz, established in 1876 and maintained with only a
 25630	short break until 1911, Mexico had become increasingly attractive to our
 25631	business men. On the invitation of President Diaz, they had invested
 25632	huge sums in Mexican lands, oil fields, and mines, and had laid the
 25633	foundations of a new industrial order. The severe regime instituted by
 25634	Diaz, however, stirred popular discontent. The peons, or serfs, demanded
 25635	the break-up of the great estates, some of which had come down from the
 25636	days of Cortez. Their clamor for "the restoration of the land to the
 25637	people could not be silenced." In 1911 Diaz was forced to resign and
 25638	left the country.
 25639	
 25640	Mexico now slid down the path to disorder. Revolutions and civil
 25641	commotions followed in swift succession. A liberal president, Madero,
 25642	installed as the successor to Diaz, was deposed in 1913 and brutally
 25643	murdered. Huerta, a military adventurer, hailed for a time as another
 25644	"strong man," succeeded Madero whose murder he was accused of
 25645	instigating. Although Great Britain and nearly all the powers of Europe
 25646	accepted the new government as lawful, the United States steadily
 25647	withheld recognition. In the meantime Mexico was torn by insurrections
 25648	under the leadership of Carranza, a friend of Madero, Villa, a bandit of
 25649	generous pretensions, and Zapata, a radical leader of the peons. Without
 25650	the support of the United States, Huerta was doomed.
 25651	
 25652	In the summer of 1914, the dictator resigned and fled from the capital,
 25653	leaving the field to Carranza. For six years the new president,
 25654	recognized by the United States, held a precarious position which he
 25655	vigorously strove to strengthen against various revolutionary movements.
 25656	At length in 1920, he too was deposed and murdered, and another military
 25657	chieftain, Obregon, installed in power.
 25658	
 25659	These events right at our door could not fail to involve the government
 25660	of the United States. In the disorders many American citizens lost their
 25661	lives. American property was destroyed and land owned by Americans was
 25662	confiscated. A new Mexican constitution, in effect nationalizing the
 25663	natural resources of the country, struck at the rights of foreign
 25664	investors. Moreover the Mexican border was in constant turmoil. Even in
 25665	the last days of his administration, Mr. Taft felt compelled to issue a
 25666	solemn warning to the Mexican government protesting against the
 25667	violation of American rights.
 25668	
 25669	President Wilson, soon after his inauguration, sent a commissioner to
 25670	Mexico to inquire into the situation. Although he declared a general
 25671	policy of "watchful waiting," he twice came to blows with Mexican
 25672	forces. In 1914 some American sailors at Tampico were arrested by a
 25673	Mexican officer; the Mexican government, although it immediately
 25674	released the men, refused to make the required apology for the incident.
 25675	As a result President Wilson ordered the landing of American forces at
 25676	Vera Cruz and the occupation of the city. A clash of arms followed in
 25677	which several Americans were killed. War seemed inevitable, but at this
 25678	juncture the governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile tendered their
 25679	good offices as mediators. After a few weeks of negotiation, during
 25680	which Huerta was forced out of power, American forces were withdrawn
 25681	from Vera Cruz and the incident closed.
 25682	
 25683	In 1916 a second break in amicable relations occurred. In the spring of
 25684	that year a band of Villa's men raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico,
 25685	killing several citizens and committing robberies. A punitive expedition
 25686	under the command of General Pershing was quickly sent out to capture
 25687	the offenders. Against the protests of President Carranza, American
 25688	forces penetrated deeply into Mexico without effecting the object of
 25689	the undertaking. This operation lasted until January, 1917, when the
 25690	imminence of war with Germany led to the withdrawal of the American
 25691	soldiers. Friendly relations were resumed with the Mexican government
 25692	and the policy of "watchful waiting" was continued.
 25693	
 25694	
 25695	THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN WAR
 25696	
 25697	=The Outbreak of the War.=--In the opening days of August, 1914, the
 25698	age-long jealousies of European nations, sharpened by new imperial
 25699	ambitions, broke out in another general conflict such as had shaken the
 25700	world in the days of Napoleon. On June 28, the heir to the
 25701	Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated at Serajevo, the capital of
 25702	Bosnia, an Austrian province occupied mainly by Serbs. With a view to
 25703	stopping Serbian agitation for independence, Austria-Hungary laid the
 25704	blame for this incident on the government of Serbia and made humiliating
 25705	demands on that country. Germany at once proposed that the issue should
 25706	be regarded as "an affair which should be settled solely between
 25707	Austria-Hungary and Serbia"; meaning that the small nation should be
 25708	left to the tender mercies of a great power. Russia refused to take this
 25709	view. Great Britain proposed a settlement by mediation. Germany backed
 25710	up Austria to the limit. To use the language of the German authorities:
 25711	"We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of
 25712	Austria-Hungary against Serbia might bring Russia upon the field and
 25713	that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our
 25714	duties as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of
 25715	Austria-Hungary which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding
 25716	attitude not compatible with his dignity nor deny him our assistance."
 25717	That made the war inevitable.
 25718	
 25719	Every day of the fateful August, 1914, was crowded with momentous
 25720	events. On the 1st, Germany declared war on Russia. On the 2d, the
 25721	Germans invaded the little duchy of Luxemburg and notified the King of
 25722	Belgium that they were preparing to violate the neutrality of his realm
 25723	on their way to Paris. On the same day, Great Britain, anxiously
 25724	besought by the French government, promised the aid of the British navy
 25725	if German warships made hostile demonstrations in the Channel. August
 25726	3d, the German government declared war on France. The following day,
 25727	Great Britain demanded of Germany respect for Belgian neutrality and,
 25728	failing to receive the guarantee, broke off diplomatic relations. On the
 25729	5th, the British prime minister announced that war had opened between
 25730	England and Germany. The storm now broke in all its pitiless fury.
 25731	
 25732	=The State of American Opinion.=--Although President Wilson promptly
 25733	proclaimed the neutrality of the United States, the sympathies of a
 25734	large majority of the American people were without doubt on the side of
 25735	Great Britain and France. To them the invasion of the little kingdom of
 25736	Belgium and the horrors that accompanied German occupation were odious
 25737	in the extreme. Moreover, they regarded the German imperial government
 25738	as an autocratic power wielded in the interest of an ambitious military
 25739	party. The Kaiser, William II, and the Crown Prince were the symbols of
 25740	royal arrogance. On the other hand, many Americans of German descent, in
 25741	memory of their ties with the Fatherland, openly sympathized with the
 25742	Central Powers; and many Americans of Irish descent, recalling their
 25743	long and bitter struggle for home rule in Ireland, would have regarded
 25744	British defeat as a merited redress of ancient grievances.
 25745	
 25746	Extremely sensitive to American opinion, but ill informed about it, the
 25747	German government soon began systematic efforts to present its cause to
 25748	the people of the United States in the most favorable light possible.
 25749	Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former colonial secretary of the German
 25750	empire, was sent to America as a special agent. For months he filled the
 25751	newspapers, magazines, and periodicals with interviews, articles, and
 25752	notes on the justice of the Teutonic cause. From a press bureau in New
 25753	York flowed a stream of pamphlets, leaflets, and cartoons. A magazine,
 25754	"The Fatherland," was founded to secure "fair play for Germany and
 25755	Austria." Several professors in American universities, who had received
 25756	their training in Germany, took up the pen in defense of the Central
 25757	Empires. The German language press, without exception it seems, the
 25758	National German Alliance, minor German societies, and Lutheran churches
 25759	came to the support of the German cause. Even the English language
 25760	papers, though generally favorable to the Entente Allies, opened their
 25761	columns in the interest of equal justice to the spokesmen for all the
 25762	contending powers of Europe.
 25763	
 25764	Before two weeks had elapsed the controversy had become so intense that
 25765	President Wilson (August 18, 1914) was moved to caution his countrymen
 25766	against falling into angry disputes. "Every man," he said, "who really
 25767	loves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which
 25768	is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all
 25769	concerned.... We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must
 25770	put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that
 25771	might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before
 25772	another."
 25773	
 25774	=The Clash over American Trade.=--As in the time of the Napoleonic wars,
 25775	the conflict in Europe raised fundamental questions respecting rights of
 25776	Americans trading with countries at peace as well as those at war. On
 25777	this point there existed on August 1, 1914, a fairly definite body of
 25778	principles by which nations were bound. Among them the following were of
 25779	vital significance. In the first place, it was recognized that an enemy
 25780	merchant ship caught on the high seas was a legitimate prize of war
 25781	which might be seized and confiscated. In the second place, it was
 25782	agreed that "contraband of war" found on an enemy or neutral ship was a
 25783	lawful prize; any ship suspected of carrying it was liable to search and
 25784	if caught with forbidden goods was subject to seizure. In the third
 25785	place, international law prescribed that a peaceful merchant ship,
 25786	whether belonging to an enemy or to a neutral country, should not be
 25787	destroyed or sunk without provision for the safety of crew and
 25788	passengers. In the fourth place, it was understood that a belligerent
 25789	had the right, if it could, to blockade the ports of an enemy and
 25790	prevent the ingress and egress of all ships; but such a blockade, to be
 25791	lawful, had to be effective.
 25792	
 25793	These general principles left undetermined two important matters: "What
 25794	is an effective blockade?" and "What is contraband of war?" The task of
 25795	answering these questions fell to Great Britain as mistress of the seas.
 25796	Although the German submarines made it impossible for her battleships to
 25797	maintain a continuous patrol of the waters in front of blockaded ports,
 25798	
 25799	she declared the blockade to be none the less "effective" because her
 25800	navy was supreme. As to contraband of war Great Britain put such a broad
 25801	interpretation upon the term as to include nearly every important
 25802	article of commerce. Early in 1915 she declared even cargoes of grain
 25803	and flour to be contraband, defending the action on the ground that the
 25804	German government had recently taken possession of all domestic stocks
 25805	of corn, wheat, and flour.
 25806	
 25807	A new question arose in connection with American trade with the neutral
 25808	countries surrounding Germany. Great Britain early began to intercept
 25809	ships carrying oil, gasoline, and copper--all war materials of prime
 25810	importance--on the ground that they either were destined ultimately to
 25811	Germany or would release goods for sale to Germans. On November 2, 1914,
 25812	the English government announced that the Germans wore sowing mines in
 25813	open waters and that therefore the whole of the North Sea was a military
 25814	zone. Ships bound for Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were ordered to come
 25815	by the English Channel for inspection and sailing directions. In effect,
 25816	Americans were now licensed by Great Britain to trade in certain
 25817	commodities and in certain amounts with neutral countries.
 25818	
 25819	Against these extraordinary measures, the State Department at Washington
 25820	lodged pointed objections, saying: "This government is reluctantly
 25821	forced to the conclusion that the present policy of His Majesty's
 25822	government toward neutral ships and cargoes exceeds the manifest
 25823	necessity of a belligerent and constitutes restrictions upon the rights
 25824	of American citizens on the high seas, which are not justified by the
 25825	rules of international law or required under the principle of
 25826	self-preservation."
 25827	
 25828	=Germany Begins the Submarine Campaign.=--Germany now announced that, on
 25829	and after February 18, 1915, the whole of the English Channel and the
 25830	waters around Great Britain would be deemed a war zone and that every
 25831	enemy ship found therein would be destroyed. The German decree added
 25832	that, as the British admiralty had ordered the use of neutral flags by
 25833	English ships in time of distress, neutral vessels would be in danger of
 25834	destruction if found in the forbidden area. It was clear that Germany
 25835	intended to employ submarines to destroy shipping. A new factor was thus
 25836	introduced into naval warfare, one not provided for in the accepted laws
 25837	of war. A warship overhauling a merchant vessel could easily take its
 25838	crew and passengers on board for safe keeping as prescribed by
 25839	international law; but a submarine ordinarily could do nothing of the
 25840	sort. Of necessity the lives and the ships of neutrals, as well as of
 25841	belligerents, were put in mortal peril. This amazing conduct Germany
 25842	justified on the ground that it was mere retaliation against Great
 25843	Britain for her violations of international law.
 25844	
 25845	The response of the United States to the ominous German order was swift
 25846	and direct. On February 10, 1915, it warned Germany that if her
 25847	commanders destroyed American lives and ships in obedience to that
 25848	decree, the action would "be very hard indeed to reconcile with the
 25849	friendly relations happily subsisting between the two governments." The
 25850	American note added that the German imperial government would be held to
 25851	"strict accountability" and all necessary steps would be taken to
 25852	safeguard American lives and American rights. This was firm and clear
 25853	language, but the only response which it evoked from Germany was a
 25854	suggestion that, if Great Britain would allow food supplies to pass
 25855	through the blockade, the submarine campaign would be dropped.
 25856	
 25857	=Violations of American Rights.=--Meanwhile Germany continued to ravage
 25858	shipping on the high seas. On January 28, a German raider sank the
 25859	American ship, _William P. Frye_, in the South Atlantic; on March 28, a
 25860	British ship, the _Falaba_, was sunk by a submarine and many on board,
 25861	including an American citizen, were killed; and on April 28, a German
 25862	airplane dropped bombs on the American steamer _Cushing_. On the morning
 25863	of May 1, 1915, Americans were astounded to see in the newspapers an
 25864	advertisement, signed by the German Imperial Embassy, warning travelers
 25865	of the dangers in the war zone and notifying them that any who ventured
 25866	on British ships into that area did so at their own risk. On that day,
 25867	the _Lusitania_, a British steamer, sailed from New York for Liverpool.
 25868	On May 7, without warning, the ship was struck by two torpedoes and in a
 25869	few minutes went down by the bow, carrying to death 1153 persons
 25870	including 114 American men, women, and children. A cry of horror ran
 25871	through the country. The German papers in America and a few American
 25872	people argued that American citizens had been duly warned of the danger
 25873	and had deliberately taken their lives into their own hands; but the
 25874	terrible deed was almost universally condemned by public opinion.
 25875	
 25876	=The _Lusitania_ Notes.=--On May 14, the Department of State at
 25877	Washington made public the first of three famous notes on the
 25878	_Lusitania_ case. It solemnly informed the German government that "no
 25879	warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly
 25880	be accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement
 25881	of the responsibility for its commission." It called upon the German
 25882	government to disavow the act, make reparation as far as possible, and
 25883	take steps to prevent "the recurrence of anything so obviously
 25884	subversive of the principles of warfare." The note closed with a clear
 25885	caution to Germany that the government of the United States would not
 25886	"omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred
 25887	duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and
 25888	of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment." The die was cast;
 25889	but Germany in reply merely temporized.
 25890	
 25891	In a second note, made public on June 11, the position of the United
 25892	States was again affirmed. William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of
 25893	State, had resigned because the drift of President Wilson's policy was
 25894	not toward mediation but the strict maintenance of American rights, if
 25895	need be, by force of arms. The German reply was still evasive and German
 25896	naval commanders continued their course of sinking merchant ships. In a
 25897	third and final note of July 21, 1915, President Wilson made it clear to
 25898	Germany that he meant what he said when he wrote that he would maintain
 25899	the rights of American citizens. Finally after much discussion and
 25900	shifting about, the German ambassador on September 1, 1915, sent a brief
 25901	note to the Secretary of State: "Liners will not be sunk by our
 25902	submarines without warning and without safety of the lives of
 25903	non-combatants, provided the liners do not try to escape or offer
 25904	resistance." Editorially, the New York _Times_ declared: "It is a
 25905	triumph not only of diplomacy but of reason, of humanity, of justice,
 25906	and of truth." The Secretary of State saw in it "a recognition of the
 25907	fundamental principles for which we have contended."
 25908	
 25909	=The Presidential Election of 1916.=--In the midst of this crisis came
 25910	the presidential campaign. On the Republican side everything seemed to
 25911	depend upon the action of the Progressives. If the breach created in
 25912	1912 could be closed, victory was possible; if not, defeat was certain.
 25913	A promise of unity lay in the fact that the conventions of the
 25914	Republicans and Progressives were held simultaneously in Chicago. The
 25915	friends of Roosevelt hoped that both parties would select him as their
 25916	candidate; but this hope was not realized. The Republicans chose, and
 25917	the Progressives accepted, Charles E. Hughes, an associate justice of
 25918	the federal Supreme Court who, as governor of New York, had won a
 25919	national reputation by waging war on "machine politicians."
 25920	
 25921	In the face of the clamor for expressions of sympathy with one or the
 25922	other of the contending powers of Europe, the Republicans chose a middle
 25923	course, declaring that they would uphold all American rights "at home
 25924	and abroad, by land and by sea." This sentiment Mr. Hughes echoed in his
 25925	acceptance speech. By some it was interpreted to mean a firmer policy in
 25926	dealing with Great Britain; by others, a more vigorous handling of the
 25927	submarine menace. The Democrats, on their side, renominated President
 25928	Wilson by acclamation, reviewed with pride the legislative achievements
 25929	of the party, and commended "the splendid diplomatic victories of our
 25930	great President who has preserved the vital interests of our government
 25931	and its citizens and kept us out of war."
 25932	
 25933	In the election which ensued President Wilson's popular vote exceeded
 25934	that cast for Mr. Hughes by more than half a million, while his
 25935	electoral vote stood 277 to 254. The result was regarded, and not
 25936	without warrant, as a great personal triumph for the President. He had
 25937	received the largest vote yet cast for a presidential candidate. The
 25938	Progressive party practically disappeared, and the Socialists suffered a
 25939	severe set-back, falling far behind the vote of 1912.
 25940	
 25941	=President Wilson Urges Peace upon the Warring Nations.=--Apparently
 25942	convinced that his pacific policies had been profoundly approved by his
 25943	countrymen, President Wilson, soon after the election, addressed "peace
 25944	notes" to the European belligerents. On December 16, the German Emperor
 25945	proposed to the Allied Powers that they enter into peace negotiations, a
 25946	suggestion that was treated as a mere political maneuver by the opposing
 25947	governments. Two days later President Wilson sent a note to the warring
 25948	nations asking them to avow "the terms upon which war might be
 25949	concluded." To these notes the Central Powers replied that they were
 25950	ready to meet their antagonists in a peace conference; and Allied Powers
 25951	answered by presenting certain conditions precedent to a satisfactory
 25952	settlement. On January 22, 1917, President Wilson in an address before
 25953	the Senate, declared it to be a duty of the United States to take part
 25954	in the establishment of a stable peace on the basis of certain
 25955	principles. These were, in short: "peace without victory"; the right of
 25956	nationalities to freedom and self-government; the independence of
 25957	Poland; freedom of the seas; the reduction of armaments; and the
 25958	abolition of entangling alliances. The whole world was discussing the
 25959	President's remarkable message, when it was dumbfounded to hear, on
 25960	January 31, that the German ambassador at Washington had announced the
 25961	official renewal of ruthless submarine warfare.
 25962	
 25963	
 25964	THE UNITED STATES AT WAR
 25965	
 25966	=Steps toward War.=--Three days after the receipt of the news that the
 25967	German government intended to return to its former submarine policy,
 25968	President Wilson severed diplomatic relations with the German empire. At
 25969	the same time he explained to Congress that he desired no conflict with
 25970	Germany and would await an "overt act" before taking further steps to
 25971	preserve American rights. "God grant," he concluded, "that we may not be
 25972	challenged to defend them by acts of willful injustice on the part of
 25973	the government of Germany." Yet the challenge came. Between February 26
 25974	and April 2, six American merchant vessels were torpedoed, in most cases
 25975	without any warning and without regard to the loss of American lives.
 25976	President Wilson therefore called upon Congress to answer the German
 25977	menace. The reply of Congress on April 6 was a resolution, passed with
 25978	only a few dissenting votes, declaring the existence of a state of war
 25979	with Germany. Austria-Hungary at once severed diplomatic relations with
 25980	the United States; but it was not until December 7 that Congress, acting
 25981	on the President's advice, declared war also on that "vassal of the
 25982	German government."
 25983	
 25984	=American War Aims.=--In many addresses at the beginning and during the
 25985	course of the war, President Wilson stated the purposes which actuated
 25986	our government in taking up arms. He first made it clear that it was a
 25987	war of self-defense. "The military masters of Germany," he exclaimed,
 25988	"denied us the right to be neutral." Proof of that lay on every hand.
 25989	Agents of the German imperial government had destroyed American lives
 25990	and American property on the high seas. They had filled our communities
 25991	with spies. They had planted bombs in ships and munition works. They had
 25992	fomented divisions among American citizens.
 25993	
 25994	Though assailed in many ways and compelled to resort to war, the United
 25995	States sought no material rewards. "The world must be made safe for
 25996	democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of
 25997	political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no
 25998	conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves."
 25999	
 26000	In a very remarkable message read to Congress on January 8, 1918,
 26001	President Wilson laid down his famous "fourteen points" summarizing the
 26002	ideals for which we were fighting. They included open treaties of peace,
 26003	openly arrived at; absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas; the
 26004	removal, as far as possible, of trade barriers among nations; reduction
 26005	of armaments; adjustment of colonial claims in the interest of the
 26006	populations concerned; fair and friendly treatment of Russia; the
 26007	restoration of Belgium; righting the wrong done to France in 1871 in the
 26008	matter of Alsace-Lorraine; adjustment of Italian frontiers along the
 26009	lines of nationality; more liberty for the peoples of Austria-Hungary;
 26010	the restoration of Serbia and Rumania; the readjustment of the Turkish
 26011	Empire; an independent Poland; and an association of nations to afford
 26012	mutual guarantees to all states great and small. On a later occasion
 26013	President Wilson elaborated the last point, namely, the formation of a
 26014	league of nations to guarantee peace and establish justice among the
 26015	powers of the world. Democracy, the right of nations to determine their
 26016	own fate, a covenant of enduring peace--these were the ideals for which
 26017	the American people were to pour out their blood and treasure.
 26018	
 26019	=The Selective Draft.=--The World War became a war of nations. The
 26020	powers against which we were arrayed had every able-bodied man in
 26021	service and all their resources, human and material, thrown into the
 26022	scale. For this reason, President Wilson summoned the whole people of
 26023	the United States to make every sacrifice necessary for victory.
 26024	Congress by law decreed that the national army should be chosen from all
 26025	male citizens and males not enemy aliens who had declared their
 26026	intention of becoming citizens. By the first act of May 18, 1917, it
 26027	fixed the age limits at twenty-one to thirty-one inclusive. Later, in
 26028	August, 1918, it extended them to eighteen and forty-five. From the men
 26029	of the first group so enrolled were chosen by lot the soldiers for the
 26030	World War who, with the regular army and the national guard, formed the
 26031	American Expeditionary Force upholding the American cause on the
 26032	battlefields of Europe. "The whole nation," said the President, "must be
 26033	a team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best
 26034	fitted."
 26035	
 26036	=Liberty Loans and Taxes.=--In order that the military and naval forces
 26037	should be stinted in no respect, the nation was called upon to place its
 26038	financial resources at the service of the government. Some urged the
 26039	"conscription of wealth as well as men," meaning the support of the war
 26040	out of taxes upon great fortunes; but more conservative counsels
 26041	prevailed. Four great Liberty Loans were floated, all the agencies of
 26042	modern publicity being employed to enlist popular interest. The first
 26043	loan had four and a half million subscribers; the fourth more than
 26044	twenty million. Combined with loans were heavy taxes. A progressive tax
 26045	was laid upon incomes beginning with four per cent on incomes in the
 26046	lower ranges and rising to sixty-three per cent of that part of any
 26047	income above $2,000,000. A progressive tax was levied upon inheritances.
 26048	An excess profits tax was laid upon all corporations and partnerships,
 26049	rising in amount to sixty per cent of the net income in excess of
 26050	thirty-three per cent on the invested capital. "This," said a
 26051	distinguished economist, "is the high-water mark in the history of
 26052	taxation. Never before in the annals of civilization has an attempt been
 26053	made to take as much as two-thirds of a man's income by taxation."
 26054	
 26055	=Mobilizing Material Resources.=--No stone was left unturned to provide
 26056	the arms, munitions, supplies, and transportation required in the
 26057	gigantic undertaking. Between the declaration of war and the armistice,
 26058	Congress enacted law after law relative to food supplies, raw materials,
 26059	railways, mines, ships, forests, and industrial enterprises. No power
 26060	over the lives and property of citizens, deemed necessary to the
 26061	prosecution of the armed conflict, was withheld from the government. The
 26062	farmer's wheat, the housewife's sugar, coal at the mines, labor in the
 26063	factories, ships at the wharves, trade with friendly countries, the
 26064	railways, banks, stores, private fortunes--all were mobilized and laid
 26065	under whatever obligations the government deemed imperative. Never was a
 26066	nation more completely devoted to a single cause.
 26067	
 26068	A law of August 10, 1917, gave the President power to fix the prices of
 26069	wheat and coal and to take almost any steps necessary to prevent
 26070	monopoly and excessive prices. By a series of measures, enlarging the
 26071	principles of the shipping act of 1916, ships and shipyards were brought
 26072	under public control and the government was empowered to embark upon a
 26073	great ship-building program. In December, 1917, the government assumed
 26074	for the period of the war the operation of the railways under a
 26075	presidential proclamation which was elaborated in March, 1918, by act of
 26076	Congress. In the summer of 1918 the express, telephone, and telegraph
 26077	business of the entire country passed under government control. By war
 26078	risk insurance acts allowances were made for the families of enlisted
 26079	men, compensation for injuries was provided, death benefits were
 26080	instituted, and a system of national insurance was established in the
 26081	interest of the men in service. Never before in the history of the
 26082	country had the government taken such a wise and humane view of its
 26083	obligations to those who served on the field of battle or on the seas.
 26084	
 26085	=The Espionage and Sedition Acts.=--By the Espionage law of June 15,
 26086	1917, and the amending law, known as the Sedition act, passed in May of
 26087	the following year, the government was given a drastic power over the
 26088	expression of opinion. The first measure penalized those who conveyed
 26089	information to a foreign country to be used to the injury of the United
 26090	States; those who made false statements designed to interfere with the
 26091	military or naval forces of the United States; those who attempted to
 26092	stir up insubordination or disloyalty in the army and navy; and those
 26093	who willfully obstructed enlistment. The Sedition act was still more
 26094	severe and sweeping in its terms. It imposed heavy penalties upon any
 26095	person who used "abusive language about the government or institutions
 26096	of the country." It authorized the dismissal of any officer of the
 26097	government who committed "disloyal acts" or uttered "disloyal language,"
 26098	and empowered the Postmaster General to close the mails to persons
 26099	violating the law. This measure, prepared by the Department of Justice,
 26100	encountered vigorous opposition in the Senate, where twenty-four
 26101	Republicans and two Democrats voted against it. Senator Johnson of
 26102	California denounced it as a law "to suppress the freedom of the press
 26103	in the United States and to prevent any man, no matter who he is, from
 26104	expressing legitimate criticism concerning the present government." The
 26105	constitutionality of the acts was attacked; but they were sustained by
 26106	the Supreme Court and stringently enforced.

 26110	THE LAUNCHING OF A SHIP AT THE GREAT NAVAL YARDS, NEWARK, N.J.]
 26111	
 26112	=Labor and the War.=--In view of the restlessness of European labor
 26113	during the war and especially the proletarian revolution in Russia in
 26114	November, 1917, some anxiety was early expressed as to the stand which
 26115	organized labor might take in the United States. It was, however, soon
 26116	dispelled. Samuel Gompers, speaking for the American Federation of
 26117	Labor, declared that "this is labor's war," and pledged the united
 26118	support of all the unions. There was some dissent. The Socialist party
 26119	denounced the war as a capitalist quarrel; but all the protests combined
 26120	were too slight to have much effect. American labor leaders were sent to
 26121	Europe to strengthen the wavering ranks of trade unionists in war-worn
 26122	England, France, and Italy. Labor was given representation on the
 26123	important boards and commissions dealing with industrial questions.
 26124	Trade union standards were accepted by the government and generally
 26125	applied in industry. The Department of Labor became one of the powerful
 26126	war centers of the nation. In a memorable address to the American
 26127	Federation of Labor, President Wilson assured the trade unionists that
 26128	labor conditions should not be made unduly onerous by the war and
 26129	received in return a pledge of loyalty from the Federation. Recognition
 26130	of labor's contribution to winning the war was embodied in the treaty of
 26131	peace, which provided for a permanent international organization to
 26132	promote the world-wide effort of labor to improve social conditions.
 26133	"The league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal
 26134	peace," runs the preamble to the labor section of the treaty, "and such
 26135	a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice....
 26136	The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an
 26137	obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the
 26138	conditions in their own countries."
 26139	
 26140	=The American Navy in the War.=--As soon as Congress declared war the
 26141	fleet was mobilized, American ports were thrown open to the warships of
 26142	the Allies, immediate provision was made for increasing the number of
 26143	men and ships, and a contingent of war vessels was sent to cooperate
 26144	with the British and French in their life-and-death contest with
 26145	submarines. Special effort was made to stimulate the production of
 26146	"submarine chasers" and "scout cruisers" to be sent to the danger zone.
 26147	Convoys were provided to accompany the transports conveying soldiers to
 26148	France. Before the end of the war more than three hundred American
 26149	vessels and 75,000 officers and men were operating in European waters.
 26150	Though the German fleet failed to come out and challenge the sea power
 26151	of the Allies, the battleships of the United States were always ready to
 26152	do their full duty in such an event. As things turned out, the service
 26153	of the American navy was limited mainly to helping in the campaign that
 26154	wore down the submarine menace to Allied shipping.
 26155	
 26156	=The War in France.=--Owing to the peculiar character of the warfare in
 26157	France, it required a longer time for American military forces to get
 26158	into action; but there was no unnecessary delay. Soon after the
 26159	declaration of war, steps were taken to give military assistance to the
 26160	Allies. The regular army was enlarged and the troops of the national
 26161	guard were brought into national service. On June 13, General John J.
 26162	Pershing, chosen head of the American Expeditionary Forces, reached
 26163	Paris and began preparations for the arrival of our troops. In June, the
 26164	vanguard of the army reached France. A slow and steady stream followed.
 26165	As soon as the men enrolled under the draft were ready, it became a
 26166	flood. During the period of the war the army was enlarged from about
 26167	190,000 men to 3,665,000, of whom more than 2,000,000 were in France
 26168	when the armistice was signed.
 26169	
 26170	Although American troops did not take part on a large scale until the
 26171	last phase of the war in 1918, several battalions of infantry were in
 26172	the trenches by October, 1917, and had their first severe encounter with
 26173	the Germans early in November. In January, 1918, they took over a part
 26174	of the front line as an American sector. In March, General Pershing
 26175	placed our forces at the disposal of General Foch, commander-in-chief of
 26176	the Allied armies. The first division, which entered the Montdidier
 26177	salient in April, soon was engaged with the enemy, "taking with splendid
 26178	dash the town of Cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized
 26179	and held steadfastly against vicious counter attacks and galling
 26180	artillery fire."
 26181	
 26182	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
 26183	
 26184	TROOPS RETURNING FROM FRANCE]
 26185	
 26186	When the Germans launched their grand drives toward the Marne and Paris,
 26187	in June and July, 1918, every available man was placed at General Foch's
 26188	command. At Belleau Wood, at Chateau-Thierry, and other points along the
 26189	deep salient made by the Germans into the French lines, American
 26190	soldiers distinguished themselves by heroic action. They also played an
 26191	important role in the counter attack that "smashed" the salient and
 26192	drove the Germans back.
 26193	
 26194	In September, American troops, with French aid, "wiped out" the German
 26195	salient at St. Mihiel. By this time General Pershing was ready for the
 26196	great American drive to the northeast in the Argonne forest, while he
 26197	also cooperated with the British in the assault on the Hindenburg line.
 26198	In the Meuse-Argonne battle, our soldiers encountered some of the most
 26199	severe fighting of the war and pressed forward steadily against the most
 26200	stubborn resistance from the enemy. On the 6th of November, reported
 26201	General Pershing, "a division of the first corps reached a point on the
 26202	Meuse opposite Sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The
 26203	strategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the
 26204	enemy's main line of communications and nothing but a surrender or an
 26205	armistice could save his army from complete disaster." Five days later
 26206	the end came. On the morning of November 11, the order to cease firing
 26207	went into effect. The German army was in rapid retreat and
 26208	demoralization had begun. The Kaiser had abdicated and fled into
 26209	Holland. The Hohenzollern dreams of empire were shattered. In the
 26210	fifty-second month, the World War, involving nearly every civilized
 26211	nation on the globe, was brought to a close. More than 75,000 American
 26212	soldiers and sailors had given their lives. More than 250,000 had been
 26213	wounded or were missing or in German prison camps.

 26219	THE SETTLEMENT AT PARIS
 26220	
 26221	=The Peace Conference.=--On January 18, 1919, a conference of the Allied
 26222	and Associated Powers assembled to pronounce judgment upon the German
 26223	empire and its defeated satellites: Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and
 26224	Turkey. It was a moving spectacle. Seventy-two delegates spoke for
 26225	thirty-two states. The United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and
 26226	Japan had five delegates each. Belgium, Brazil, and Serbia were each
 26227	assigned three. Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, China, Greece,
 26228	Hedjaz, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, and Czechoslovakia were
 26229	allotted two apiece. The remaining states of New Zealand, Bolivia, Cuba,
 26230	Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru,
 26231	and Uruguay each had one delegate. President Wilson spoke in person for
 26232	the United States. England, France, and Italy were represented by their
 26233	premiers: David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando.

 26237	
 26238	=The Supreme Council.=--The real work of the settlement was first
 26239	committed to a Supreme Council of ten representing the United States,
 26240	Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. This was later reduced to five
 26241	members. Then Japan dropped out and finally Italy, leaving only
 26242	President Wilson and the Premiers, Lloyd George and Clemenceau, the
 26243	"Big Three," who assumed the burden of mighty decisions. On May 6, their
 26244	work was completed and in a secret session of the full conference the
 26245	whole treaty of peace was approved, though a few of the powers made
 26246	reservations or objections. The next day the treaty was presented to the
 26247	Germans who, after prolonged protests, signed on the last day of grace,
 26248	June 28. This German treaty was followed by agreements with Austria,
 26249	Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Collectively these great documents formed
 26250	the legal basis of the general European settlement.
 26251	
 26252	=The Terms of the Settlement.=--The combined treaties make a huge
 26253	volume. The German treaty alone embraces about 80,000 words.
 26254	Collectively they cover an immense range of subjects which may be
 26255	summarized under five heads: (1) The territorial settlement in Europe;
 26256	(2) the destruction of German military power; (3) reparations for
 26257	damages done by Germany and her allies; (4) the disposition of German
 26258	colonies and protectorates; and (5) the League of Nations.
 26259	
 26260	Germany was reduced by the cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the
 26261	loss of several other provinces. Austria-Hungary was dissolved and
 26262	dismembered. Russia was reduced by the creation of new states on the
 26263	west. Bulgaria was stripped of her gains in the recent Balkan wars.
 26264	Turkey was dismembered. Nine new independent states were created:
 26265	Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia,
 26266	Armenia, and Hedjaz. Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Serbia were enlarged by
 26267	cessions of territory and Serbia was transformed into the great state of
 26268	Jugoslavia.
 26269	
 26270	The destruction of German military power was thorough. The entire navy,
 26271	with minor exceptions, was turned over to the Allied and Associated
 26272	Powers; Germany's total equipment for the future was limited to six
 26273	battleships and six light cruisers, with certain small vessels but no
 26274	submarines. The number of enlisted men and officers for the army was
 26275	fixed at not more than 100,000; the General Staff was dissolved; and the
 26276	manufacture of munitions restricted.
 26277	
 26278	Germany was compelled to accept full responsibility for all damages; to
 26279	pay five billion dollars in cash and goods, and to make certain other
 26280	payments which might be ordered from time to time by an inter-allied
 26281	reparations commission. She was also required to deliver to Belgium,
 26282	France, and Italy, millions of tons of coal every year for ten years;
 26283	while by way of additional compensation to France the rich coal basin of
 26284	the Saar was placed under inter-allied control to be exploited under
 26285	French administration for a period of at least fifteen years. Austria
 26286	and the other associates of Germany were also laid under heavy
 26287	obligations to the victors. Damages done to shipping by submarines and
 26288	other vessels were to be paid for on the basis of ton for ton.
 26289	
 26290	The disposition of the German colonies and the old Ottoman empire
 26291	presented knotty problems. It was finally agreed that the German
 26292	colonies and Turkish provinces which were in a backward stage of
 26293	development should be placed under the tutelage of certain powers acting
 26294	as "mandatories" holding them in "a sacred trust of civilization." An
 26295	exception to the mandatory principle arose in the case of German rights
 26296	in Shantung, all of which were transferred directly to Japan. It was
 26297	this arrangement that led the Chinese delegation to withhold their
 26298	signatures from the treaty.
 26299	
 26300	=The League of Nations.=--High among the purposes which he had in mind
 26301	in summoning the nation to arms, President Wilson placed the desire to
 26302	put an end to war. All through the United States the people spoke of the
 26303	"war to end war." No slogan called forth a deeper response from the
 26304	public. The President himself repeatedly declared that a general
 26305	association of nations must be formed to guard the peace and protect all
 26306	against the ambitions of the few. "As I see it," he said in his address
 26307	on opening the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign, "the constitution of the
 26308	League of Nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a
 26309	part, in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement
 26310	itself."
 26311	
 26312	Nothing was more natural, therefore, than Wilson's insistence at Paris
 26313	upon the formation of an international association. Indeed he had gone
 26314	to Europe in person largely to accomplish that end. Part One of the
 26315	treaty with Germany, the Covenant of the League of Nations, was due to
 26316	his labors more than to any other influence. Within the League thus
 26317	created were to be embraced all the Allied and Associated Powers and
 26318	nearly all the neutrals. By a two-thirds vote of the League Assembly the
 26319	excluded nations might be admitted.
 26320	
 26321	The agencies of the League of Nations were to be three in number: (1) a
 26322	permanent secretariat located at Geneva; (2) an Assembly consisting of
 26323	one delegate from each country, dominion, or self-governing colony
 26324	(including Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and India); (3)
 26325	and a Council consisting of representatives of the United States, Great
 26326	Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, and four other representatives
 26327	selected by the Assembly from time to time.
 26328	
 26329	The duties imposed on the League and the obligations accepted by its
 26330	members were numerous and important. The Council was to take steps to
 26331	formulate a scheme for the reduction of armaments and to submit a plan
 26332	for the establishment of a permanent Court of International Justice. The
 26333	members of the League (Article X) were to respect and preserve as
 26334	against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing
 26335	political independence of all the associated nations. They were to
 26336	submit to arbitration or inquiry by the Council all disputes which could
 26337	not be adjusted by diplomacy and in no case to resort to war until three
 26338	months after the award. Should any member disregard its covenants, its
 26339	action would be considered an act of war against the League, which would
 26340	accordingly cut off the trade and business of the hostile member and
 26341	recommend through the Council to the several associated governments the
 26342	military measures to be taken. In case the decision in any arbitration
 26343	of a dispute was unanimous, the members of the League affected by it
 26344	were to abide by it.
 26345	
 26346	Such was the settlement at Paris and such was the association of nations
 26347	formed to promote the peace of the world. They were quickly approved by
 26348	most of the powers, and the first Assembly of the League of Nations met
 26349	at Geneva late in 1920.
 26350	
 26351	=The Treaty in the United States.=--When the treaty was presented to the
 26352	United States Senate for approval, a violent opposition appeared. In
 26353	that chamber the Republicans had a slight majority and a two-thirds vote
 26354	was necessary for ratification. The sentiment for and against the treaty
 26355	ran mainly along party lines; but the Republicans were themselves
 26356	divided. The major portion, known as "reservationists," favored
 26357	ratification with certain conditions respecting American rights; while a
 26358	small though active minority rejected the League of Nations in its
 26359	entirety, announcing themselves to be "irreconcilables." The grounds of
 26360	this Republican opposition lay partly in the terms of peace imposed on
 26361	Germany and partly in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Exception
 26362	was taken to the clauses which affected the rights of American citizens
 26363	in property involved in the adjustment with Germany, but the burden of
 26364	criticism was directed against the League. Article X guaranteeing
 26365	against external aggression the political independence and territorial
 26366	integrity of the members of the League was subjected to a specially
 26367	heavy fire; while the treatment accorded to China and the sections
 26368	affecting American internal affairs were likewise attacked as "unjust
 26369	and dangerous." As an outcome of their deliberations, the Republicans
 26370	proposed a long list of reservations which touched upon many of the
 26371	vital parts of the treaty. These were rejected by President Wilson as
 26372	amounting in effect to a "nullification of the treaty." As a deadlock
 26373	ensued the treaty was definitely rejected, owing to the failure of its
 26374	sponsors to secure the requisite two-thirds vote.
 26375	
 26376	[Illustration: EUROPE]
 26377	
 26378	=The League of Nations in the Campaign of 1920.=--At this juncture the
 26379	presidential campaign of 1920 opened. The Republicans, while condemning
 26380	the terms of the proposed League, endorsed the general idea of an
 26381	international agreement to prevent war. Their candidate, Senator
 26382	Warren G. Harding of Ohio, maintained a similar position without saying
 26383	definitely whether the League devised at Paris could be recast in such a
 26384	manner as to meet his requirements. The Democrats, on the other hand,
 26385	while not opposing limitations clarifying the obligations of the United
 26386	States, demanded "the immediate ratification of the treaty without
 26387	reservations which would impair its essential integrity." The Democratic
 26388	candidate, Governor James M. Cox, of Ohio, announced his firm conviction
 26389	that the United States should "go into the League," without closing the
 26390	door to mild reservations; he appealed to the country largely on that
 26391	issue. The election of Senator Harding, in an extraordinary "landslide,"
 26392	coupled with the return of a majority of Republicans to the Senate, made
 26393	uncertain American participation in the League of Nations.
 26394	
 26395	=The United States and International Entanglements.=--Whether America
 26396	entered the League or not, it could not close its doors to the world and
 26397	escape perplexing international complications. It had ever-increasing
 26398	financial and commercial connections with all other countries. Our
 26399	associates in the recent war were heavily indebted to our government.
 26400	The prosperity of American industries depended to a considerable extent
 26401	upon the recovery of the impoverished and battle-torn countries of
 26402	Europe.
 26403	
 26404	There were other complications no less specific. The United States was
 26405	compelled by force of circumstances to adopt a Russian policy. The
 26406	government of the Czar had been overthrown by a liberal revolution,
 26407	which in turn had been succeeded by an extreme, communist
 26408	"dictatorship." The Bolsheviki, or majority faction of the socialists,
 26409	had obtained control of the national council of peasants, workingmen,
 26410	and soldiers, called the soviet, and inaugurated a radical regime. They
 26411	had made peace with Germany in March, 1918. Thereupon the United States
 26412	joined England, France, and Japan in an unofficial war upon them. After
 26413	the general settlement at Paris in 1919, our government, while
 26414	withdrawing troops from Siberia and Archangel, continued in its refusal
 26415	to recognize the Bolshevists or to permit unhampered trade with them.
 26416	President Wilson repeatedly denounced them as the enemies of
 26417	civilization and undertook to lay down for all countries the principles
 26418	which should govern intercourse with Russia.
 26419	
 26420	Further international complications were created in connection with the
 26421	World War, wholly apart from the terms of peace or the League of
 26422	Nations. The United States had participated in a general European
 26423	conflict which changed the boundaries of countries, called into being
 26424	new nations, and reduced the power and territories of the vanquished.
 26425	Accordingly, it was bound to face the problem of how far it was prepared
 26426	to cooperate with the victors in any settlement of Europe's
 26427	difficulties. By no conceivable process, therefore, could America be
 26428	disentangled from the web of world affairs. Isolation, if desirable, had
 26429	become impossible. Within three hundred years from the founding of the
 26430	tiny settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth, America, by virtue of its
 26431	institutions, its population, its wealth, and its commerce, had become
 26432	first among the nations of the earth. By moral obligations and by
 26433	practical interests its fate was thus linked with the destiny of all
 26434	mankind.
 26435	
 26436	
 26437	SUMMARY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR
 26438	
 26439	The astounding industrial progress that characterized the period
 26440	following the Civil War bequeathed to the new generation many perplexing
 26441	problems connected with the growth of trusts and railways, the
 26442	accumulation of great fortunes, the increase of poverty in the
 26443	industrial cities, the exhaustion of the free land, and the acquisition
 26444	of dominions in distant seas. As long as there was an abundance of land
 26445	in the West any able-bodied man with initiative and industry could
 26446	become an independent farmer. People from the cities and immigrants from
 26447	Europe had always before them that gateway to property and prosperity.
 26448	When the land was all gone, American economic conditions inevitably
 26449	became more like those of Europe.
 26450	
 26451	Though the new economic questions had been vigorously debated in many
 26452	circles before his day, it was President Roosevelt who first discussed
 26453	them continuously from the White House. The natural resources of the
 26454	country were being exhausted; he advocated their conservation. Huge
 26455	fortunes were being made in business creating inequalities in
 26456	opportunity; he favored reducing them by income and inheritance taxes.
 26457	Industries were disturbed by strikes; he pressed arbitration upon
 26458	capital and labor. The free land was gone; he declared that labor was in
 26459	a less favorable position to bargain with capital and therefore should
 26460	organize in unions for collective bargaining. There had been wrong-doing
 26461	on the part of certain great trusts; those responsible should be
 26462	punished.
 26463	
 26464	The spirit of reform was abroad in the land. The spoils system was
 26465	attacked. It was alleged that the political parties were dominated by
 26466	"rings and bosses." The United States Senate was called "a millionaires'
 26467	club." Poverty and misery were observed in the cities. State
 26468	legislatures and city governments were accused of corruption.
 26469	
 26470	In answer to the charges, remedies were proposed and adopted. Civil
 26471	service reform was approved. The Australian ballot, popular election of
 26472	Senators, the initiative, referendum, and recall, commission and city
 26473	manager plans for cities, public regulation of railways, compensation
 26474	for those injured in industries, minimum wages for women and children,
 26475	pensions for widows, the control of housing in the cities--these and a
 26476	hundred other reforms were adopted and tried out. The national watchword
 26477	became: "America, Improve Thyself."
 26478	
 26479	The spirit of reform broke into both political parties. It appeared in
 26480	many statutes enacted by Congress under President Taft's leadership. It
 26481	disrupted the Republicans temporarily in 1912 when the Progressive party
 26482	entered the field. It led the Democratic candidate in that year,
 26483	Governor Wilson, to make a "progressive appeal" to the voters. It
 26484	inspired a considerable program of national legislation under President
 26485	Wilson's two administrations.
 26486	
 26487	In the age of change, four important amendments to the federal
 26488	constitution, the first in more than forty years, were adopted. The
 26489	sixteenth empowered Congress to lay an income tax. The seventeenth
 26490	assured popular election of Senators. The eighteenth made prohibition
 26491	national. The nineteenth, following upon the adoption of woman suffrage
 26492	in many states, enfranchised the women of the nation.
 26493	
 26494	In the sphere of industry, equally great changes took place. The major
 26495	portion of the nation's business passed into the hands of corporations.
 26496	In all the leading industries of the country labor was organized into
 26497	trade unions and federated in a national organization. The power of
 26498	organized capital and organized labor loomed upon the horizon. Their
 26499	struggles, their rights, and their place in the economy of the nation
 26500	raised problems of the first magnitude.
 26501	
 26502	While the country was engaged in a heated debate upon its domestic
 26503	issues, the World War broke out in Europe in 1914. As a hundred years
 26504	before, American rights upon the high seas became involved at once. They
 26505	were invaded on both sides; but Germany, in addition to assailing
 26506	American ships and property, ruthlessly destroyed American lives. She
 26507	set at naught the rules of civilized warfare upon the sea. Warnings from
 26508	President Wilson were without avail. Nothing could stay the hand of the
 26509	German war party.
 26510	
 26511	After long and patient negotiations, President Wilson in 1917 called
 26512	upon the nation to take up arms against an assailant that had in effect
 26513	declared war upon America. The answer was swift and firm. The national
 26514	resources, human and material, were mobilized. The navy was enlarged, a
 26515	draft army created, huge loans floated, heavy taxes laid, and the spirit
 26516	of sacrifice called forth in a titanic struggle against an autocratic
 26517	power that threatened to dominate Europe and the World.
 26518	
 26519	In the end, American financial, naval, and military assistance counted
 26520	heavily in the scale. American sailors scoured the seas searching for
 26521	the terrible submarines. American soldiers took part in the last great
 26522	drives that broke the might of Germany's army. Such was the nation's
 26523	response to the President's summons to arms in a war "for democracy" and
 26524	"to end war."
 26525	
 26526	When victory crowned the arms of the powers united against Germany,
 26527	President Wilson in person took part in the peace council. He sought to
 26528	redeem his pledge to end wars by forming a League of Nations to keep the
 26529	peace. In the treaty drawn at the close of the war the first part was a
 26530	covenant binding the nations in a permanent association for the
 26531	settlement of international disputes. This treaty, the President offered
 26532	to the United States Senate for ratification and to his country for
 26533	approval.
 26534	
 26535	Once again, as in the days of the Napoleonic wars, the people seriously
 26536	discussed the place of America among the powers of the earth. The Senate
 26537	refused to ratify the treaty. World politics then became an issue in the
 26538	campaign of 1920. Though some Americans talked as if the United States
 26539	could close its doors and windows against all mankind, the victor in the
 26540	election, Senator Harding, of Ohio, knew better. The election returns
 26541	were hardly announced before he began to ask the advice of his
 26542	countrymen on the pressing theme that would not be downed: "What part
 26543	shall America--first among the nations of the earth in wealth and
 26544	power--assume at the council table of the world?"

 26661	We the people of the United States, in order to form a more

 26673	
 26674	
 26675	SECTION 2. 1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members
 26676	chosen every second year by the people of the several States, and the

 26689	term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all
 26690	other persons.[3] The actual enumeration shall be made within three
 26691	years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and
 26692	within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall
 26693	by law direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for

 26717	expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of
 26718	the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth
 26719	year, so that one-third may be chosen every second year; and if
 26720	vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the
 26721	legislature of any State, the executive thereof may make temporary
 26722	appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then

 26737	6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When
 26738	sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the
 26739	President of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall
 26740	preside: And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of
 26741	two-thirds of the members present.
 26742	
 26743	7. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to
 26744	removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office
 26745	of honor, trust, or profit under the United States: but the party

 26765	may provide.
 26766	
 26767	2. Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its

 26769	two-thirds, expel a member.
 26770	
 26771	3. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to
 26772	time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment
 26773	require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on
 26774	any question shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be
 26775	entered on the journal.
 26776	
 26777	4. Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the
 26778	consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other

 26784	of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all cases, except
 26785	treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest
 26786	during their attendance at the sessions of their respective Houses, and
 26787	in going to and returning from the same; and, for any speech or debate
 26788	in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.
 26789	
 26790	2. No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was
 26791	elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the
 26792	United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof
 26793	shall have been increased during such time; and no person, holding any
 26794	office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during
 26795	his continuance in office.
 26796	
 26797	
 26798	SECTION 7. 1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House
 26799	of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments
 26800	as on other bills.
 26801	
 26802	2. Every bill, which shall have passed the House of Representatives; and
 26803	the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President
 26804	of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he
 26805	shall return it with his objections to that House, in which it shall
 26806	have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their
 26807	journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration
 26808	two-thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent,
 26809	together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall
 26810	likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House,
 26811	it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses
 26812	shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons
 26813	voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each
 26814	House respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President
 26815	within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to
 26816	him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it,
 26817	unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which
 26818	case it shall not be a law.
 26819	
 26820	3. Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the
 26821	Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a
 26822	question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the
 26823	United States and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved
 26824	by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of
 26825	the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and
 26826	limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.

 26954	
 26955	2. Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof
 26956	may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators
 26957	and representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress;
 26958	but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust
 26959	or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.[7] The
 26960	electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot for
 26961	two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same
 26962	State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons
 26963	voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall
 26964	sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of
 26965	the United States, directed to the president of the Senate. The
 26966	President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House
 26967	of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then
 26968	be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the

 26974	shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the
 26975	President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from
 26976	each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a
 26977	member or members from two-thirds of the States and a majority of all
 26978	the States shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the
 26979	choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of votes
 26980	of the electors shall be the Vice-President. But if there should remain
 26981	two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from them by
 26982	ballot the Vice-President.[8]
 26983	
 26984	3. The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the
 26985	day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same
 26986	throughout the United States.
 26987	
 26988	4. No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United

 26996	resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said
 26997	office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President, and the Congress
 26998	may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or
 26999	inability both of the President and Vice-President, declaring what
 27000	officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act
 27001	accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be
 27002	elected.
 27003	
 27004	6. The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services a
 27005	compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the
 27006	period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive
 27007	within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of
 27008	them.
 27009	
 27010	7. Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the
 27011	following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I
 27012	will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States,
 27013	and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the
 27014	Constitution of the United States."
 27015	
 27016	
 27017	SECTION 2. 1. The President shall be commander-in-chief of the army and
 27018	navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,
 27019	when called into the actual service of the United States; he may require
 27020	the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the
 27021	executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their
 27022	respective offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves and
 27023	pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of
 27024	impeachment.
 27025	
 27026	2. He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the
 27027	Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present
 27028	concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of
 27029	the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and
 27030	consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the
 27031	United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for,
 27032	and which shall be established by law: but the Congress may by law vest
 27033	the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the
 27034	President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.
 27035	
 27036	3. The President shall have power to fill all vacancies that may happen
 27037	during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall
 27038	expire at the end of their next session.
 27039	
 27040	
 27041	SECTION 3. He shall from time to time give to the Congress information
 27042	on the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such
 27043	measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on
 27044	extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in
 27045	case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of
 27046	adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper;
 27047	he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers; he shall take
 27048	care that the laws be faithfully executed, and shall commission all the
 27049	officers of the United States.
 27050	
 27051	
 27052	SECTION 4. The President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the
 27053	United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and

 27062	inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and
 27063	shall, at stated times, receive for their services a compensation, which
 27064	shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.
 27065	
 27066	
 27067	SECTION 2. 1. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and
 27068	equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States,

 27646	A TOPICAL SYLLABUS
 27647	
 27648	As a result of a wholesome reaction against the purely chronological
 27649	treatment of history, there is now a marked tendency in the direction of
 27650	a purely topical handling of the subject. The topical method, however,
 27651	may also be pushed too far. Each successive stage of any topic can be
 27652	understood only in relation to the forces of the time. For that reason,
 27653	the best results are reached when there is a combination of the
 27654	chronological and the topical methods. It is therefore suggested that
 27655	the teacher first follow the text closely and then review the subject
 27656	with the aid of this topical syllabus. The references are to pages.

 29598	distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 29599	(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 29600	Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 29601	Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 29602	http://gutenberg.net/license).

 29605	Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 29606	electronic works
 29607	
 29608	1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 29609	electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 29610	and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 29611	(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 29612	the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 29613	all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 29614	If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 29615	Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 29616	terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 29617	entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
 29618	
 29619	1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 29620	used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 29621	agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 29622	things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 29623	even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 29624	paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 29625	Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 29626	and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 29627	works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
 29628	
 29629	1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 29630	or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 29631	Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 29632	collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 29633	individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 29634	located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 29635	copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 29636	works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 29637	are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 29638	Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 29639	freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 29640	this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 29641	the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 29642	keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 29643	Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
 29644	
 29645	1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 29646	what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 29647	a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 29648	the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 29649	before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 29650	creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 29651	Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 29652	the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 29653	States.
 29654	
 29655	1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
 29656	
 29657	1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 29658	access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 29659	whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 29660	phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 29661	Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 29662	copied or distributed:
 29663	
 29664	This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 29665	almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or

 29667	with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
 29668	
 29669	1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 29670	from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 29671	posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 29672	and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 29673	or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 29674	with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 29675	work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 29676	through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 29677	Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 29678	1.E.9.
 29679	
 29680	1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 29681	with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 29682	must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 29683	terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 29684	to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the

 29686	
 29687	1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 29688	License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 29689	work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
 29690	
 29691	1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 29692	electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

 29694	active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 29695	Gutenberg-tm License.
 29696	
 29697	1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 29698	compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 29699	word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 29700	distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 29701	"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 29702	posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 29703	you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 29704	copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 29705	request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 29706	form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 29707	License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
 29708	
 29709	1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 29710	performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 29711	unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
 29712	
 29713	1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 29714	access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 29715	that
 29716	
 29717	- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
 29718	     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
 29719	     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
 29720	     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
 29721	     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
 29722	     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
 29723	     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
 29724	     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
 29725	     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
 29726	     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
 29727	     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
 29728	     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
 29729	
 29730	- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 29731	     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 29732	     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 29733	     License.  You must require such a user to return or
 29734	     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
 29735	     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
 29736	     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
 29737	
 29738	- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
 29739	     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 29740	     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
 29741	     of receipt of the work.
 29742	
 29743	- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 29744	     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
 29745	
 29746	1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 29747	electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 29748	forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 29749	both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 29750	Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 29751	Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
 29752	
 29753	1.F.
 29754	
 29755	1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 29756	effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 29757	public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 29758	collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 29759	works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 29760	"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 29761	corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 29762	property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 29763	computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 29764	your equipment.
 29765	
 29766	1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 29767	of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 29768	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 29769	Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 29770	Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 29771	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 29772	fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 29773	LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 29774	PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 29775	TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 29776	LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 29777	INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 29778	DAMAGE.
 29779	
 29780	1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 29781	defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 29782	receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 29783	written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 29784	received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 29785	your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 29786	the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 29787	refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 29788	providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 29789	receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 29790	is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 29791	opportunities to fix the problem.
 29792	
 29793	1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 29794	in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 29795	WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 29796	WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
 29797	
 29798	1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 29799	warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 29800	If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 29801	law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 29802	interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 29803	the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 29804	provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
 29805	
 29806	1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 29807	trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 29808	providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 29809	with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 29810	promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 29811	harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 29812	that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 29813	or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 29814	work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 29815	Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
 29816	
 29817	
 29818	Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 29819	
 29820	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 29821	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 29822	including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 29823	because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 29824	people in all walks of life.
 29825	
 29826	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 29827	assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 29828	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 29829	remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 29830	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 29831	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
 29832	To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 29833	and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 29834	and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 29836	
 29837	Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
 29838	Foundation
 29839	
 29840	The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
 29841	501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
 29842	state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
 29843	Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
 29844	number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
 29845	http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
 29846	Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent

 29862	
 29863	Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 29864	Literary Archive Foundation
 29865	
 29866	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 29867	spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 29868	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 29869	freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 29870	array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 29871	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 29872	status with the IRS.
 29873	
 29874	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 29875	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 29876	States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 29877	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 29878	with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 29879	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 29880	SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 29881	particular state visit http://pglaf.org
 29882	
 29883	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 29884	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 29885	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 29886	approach us with offers to donate.
 29887	
 29888	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 29889	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 29890	outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 29891	
 29892	Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 29893	methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 29894	ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 29895	donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
 29896	
 29897	
 29898	Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 29899	works.
 29900	
 29901	Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 29902	concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 29903	with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 29904	Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 29905	
 29906	
 29907	Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 29908	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 29909	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 29910	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 29911	
 29912	
 29913	Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
 29914	
 29915	     http://www.gutenberg.net
 29916	
 29917	This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 29918	including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 29919	Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 29920	subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

 30024	PREFACE TO SIXTH EDITION
 30025	
 30026	
 30027	Much has happened since this Manual was last revised, and many surgical
 30028	lessons have been learned in the hard school of war. Some may yet have
 30029	to be unlearned, and others have but little bearing on the problems
 30030	presented to the civilian surgeon. Save in its broadest principles, the
 30031	surgery of warfare is a thing apart from the general surgery of civil
 30032	life, and the exhaustive literature now available on every aspect of it
 30033	makes it unnecessary that it should receive detailed consideration in a
 30034	manual for students. In preparing this new edition, therefore, we have
 30035	endeavoured to incorporate only such additions to our knowledge and
 30036	resources as our experience leads us to believe will prove of permanent
 30037	value in civil practice.
 30038	
 30039	For the rest, the text has been revised, condensed, and in places
 30040	rearranged; a number of old illustrations have been discarded, and a
 30041	greater number of new ones added. Descriptions of operative procedures
 30042	have been omitted from the _Manual_, as they are to be found in the
 30043	companion volume on _Operative Surgery_, the third edition of which
 30044	appeared some months ago.
 30045	
 30046	We have retained the Basle anatomical nomenclature, as extended
 30047	experience has confirmed our preference for it. For the convenience of
 30048	readers who still employ the old terms, these are given in brackets
 30049	after the new.
 30050	
 30051	This edition of the _Manual_ appears in three volumes; the first being
 30052	devoted to General Surgery, the other two to Regional Surgery. This
 30053	arrangement has enabled us to deal in a more consecutive manner than
 30054	hitherto with the surgery of the Extremities, including Fractures and
 30055	Dislocations.
 30056	
 30057	We have once more to express our thanks to colleagues in the Edinburgh
 30058	School and to other friends for aiding us in providing new
 30059	illustrations, and for other valuable help, as well as to our publishers
 30060	for their generosity in the matter of illustrations.

 30522	INTRODUCTION
 30523	
 30524	To prolong human life and to alleviate suffering are the ultimate
 30525	objects of scientific medicine. The two great branches of the healing
 30526	art--Medicine and Surgery--are so intimately related that it is
 30527	impossible to draw a hard-and-fast line between them, but for
 30528	convenience Surgery may be defined as "the art of treating lesions and
 30529	malformations of the human body by manual operations, mediate and
 30530	immediate." To apply his art intelligently and successfully, it is
 30531	essential that the surgeon should be conversant not only with the normal
 30532	anatomy and physiology of the body and with the various pathological
 30533	conditions to which it is liable, but also with the nature of the
 30534	process by which repair of injured or diseased tissues is effected.
 30535	Without this knowledge he is unable to recognise such deviations from
 30536	the normal as result from mal-development, injury, or disease, or
 30537	rationally to direct his efforts towards the correction or removal of
 30538	these.
 30539	
 30540	
 30541	PROCESS OF REPAIR
 30542	
 30543	The process of repair in living tissue depends upon an inherent power
 30544	possessed by vital cells of reacting to the irritation caused by injury
 30545	or disease. The cells of the damaged tissues, under the influence of
 30546	this irritation, undergo certain proliferative changes, which are
 30547	designed to restore the normal structure and configuration of the part.
 30548	The process by which this restoration is effected is essentially the
 30549	same in all tissues, but the extent to which different tissues can carry
 30550	the recuperative process varies. Simple structures, such as skin,
 30551	cartilage, bone, periosteum, and tendon, for example, have a high power
 30552	of regeneration, and in them the reparative process may result in almost
 30553	perfect restitution to the normal. More complex structures, on the other
 30554	hand, such as secreting glands, muscle, and the tissues of the central
 30555	nervous system, are but imperfectly restored, simple cicatricial
 30556	connective tissue taking the place of what has been lost or destroyed.
 30557	Any given tissue can be replaced only by tissue of a similar kind, and
 30558	in a damaged part each element takes its share in the reparative process
 30559	by producing new material which approximates more or less closely to the
 30560	normal according to the recuperative capacity of the particular tissue.
 30561	The normal process of repair may be interfered with by various
 30562	extraneous agencies, the most important of which are infection by
 30563	disease-producing micro-organisms, the presence of foreign substances,
 30564	undue movement of the affected part, and improper applications and
 30565	dressings. The effect of these agencies is to delay repair or to prevent
 30566	the individual tissues carrying the process to the furthest degree of
 30567	which they are capable.
 30568	
 30569	In the management of wounds and other diseased conditions the main
 30570	object of the surgeon is to promote the natural reparative process by
 30571	preventing or eliminating any factor by which it may be disturbed.
 30572	
 30573	#Healing by Primary Union.#--The most favourable conditions for the
 30574	progress of the reparative process are to be found in a clean-cut wound
 30575	of the integument, which is uncomplicated by loss of tissue, by the
 30576	presence of foreign substances, or by infection with disease-producing
 30577	micro-organisms, and its edges are in contact. Such a wound in virtue of
 30578	the absence of infection is said to be _aseptic_, and under these
 30579	conditions healing takes place by what is called "primary union"--the
 30580	"healing by first intention" of the older writers.
 30581	
 30582	#Granulation Tissue.#--The essential and invariable medium of repair in
 30583	all structures is an elementary form of new tissue known as _granulation
 30584	tissue_, which is produced in the damaged area in response to the
 30585	irritation caused by injury or disease. The vital reaction induced by
 30586	such irritation results in dilatation of the vessels of the part,
 30587	emigration of leucocytes, transudation of lymph, and certain
 30588	proliferative changes in the fixed tissue cells. These changes are
 30589	common to the processes of inflammation and repair; no hard-and-fast
 30590	line can be drawn between these processes, and the two may go on
 30591	together. It is, however, only when the proliferative changes have come
 30592	to predominate that the reparative process is effectively established by
 30593	the production of healthy granulation tissue.
 30594	
 30595	_Formation of Granulation Tissue._--When a wound is made in the
 30596	integument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through
 30597	the tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon
 30598	coagulates on the cut surfaces. In each of the divided vessels a clot
 30599	forms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the
 30600	surface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and
 30601	devitalised tissue. If the wound is closed, the narrow space between its
 30602	edges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white
 30603	corpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary
 30604	uniting medium between the divided surfaces. During the first twelve
 30605	hours, the minute vessels in the vicinity of the wound dilate, and from
 30606	them lymph exudes and leucocytes migrate into the tissues. In from
 30607	twenty-four to thirty-six hours, the capillaries of the part adjacent to
 30608	the wound begin to throw out minute buds and fine processes, which
 30609	bridge the gap and form a firmer, but still temporary, connection
 30610	between the two sides. Each bud begins in the wall of the capillary as a
 30611	small accumulation of granular protoplasm, which gradually elongates
 30612	into a filament containing a nucleus. This filament either joins with a
 30613	neighbouring capillary or with a similar filament, and in time these
 30614	become hollow and are filled with blood from the vessels that gave them
 30615	origin. In this way a series of young _capillary loops_ is formed.
 30616	
 30617	The spaces between these loops are filled by cells of various kinds, the
 30618	most important being the _fibroblasts_, which are destined to form
 30619	cicatricial fibrous tissue. These fibroblasts are large irregular
 30620	nucleated cells derived mainly from the proliferation of the fixed
 30621	connective-tissue cells of the part, and to a less extent from the
 30622	lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells which have migrated from the
 30623	vessels. Among the fibroblasts, larger multi-nucleated cells--_giant
 30624	cells_--are sometimes found, particularly when resistant substances,
 30625	such as silk ligatures or fragments of bone, are embedded in the
 30626	tissues, and their function seems to be to soften such substances
 30627	preliminary to their being removed by the phagocytes. Numerous
 30628	_polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes_, which have wandered from the vessels,
 30629	are also present in the spaces. These act as phagocytes, their function
 30630	being to remove the red corpuscles and fibrin of the original clot, and
 30631	this performed, they either pass back into the circulation in virtue of
 30632	their amoeboid movement, or are themselves eaten up by the growing
 30633	fibroblasts. Beyond this phagocytic action, they do not appear to play
 30634	any direct part in the reparative process. These young capillary loops,
 30635	with their supporting cells and fluids, constitute granulation tissue,
 30636	which is usually fully formed in from three to five days, after which it
 30637	begins to be replaced by cicatricial or scar tissue.
 30638	
 30639	_Formation of Cicatricial Tissue._--The transformation of this temporary
 30640	granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts,
 30641	which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around
 30642	them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity
 30643	till it replaces the cell protoplasm. In this way white fibrous tissue
 30644	is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and
 30645	eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white
 30646	fibrous tissue. In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries,
 30647	until at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells
 30648	have almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by
 30649	cicatricial tissue. In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated,
 30650	and the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction--_cicatricial
 30651	contraction_.
 30652	
 30653	_Healing of Epidermis._--While these changes are taking place in the
 30654	deeper parts of the wound, the surface is being covered over by
 30655	_epidermis_ growing in from the margins. Within twelve hours the cells
 30656	of the rete Malpighii close to the cut edge begin to sprout on to the
 30657	surface of the wound, and by their proliferation gradually cover the
 30658	granulations with a thin pink pellicle. As the epithelium increases in
 30659	thickness it assumes a bluish hue and eventually the cells become
 30660	cornified and the epithelium assumes a greyish-white colour.
 30661	
 30662	_Clinical Aspects._--So long as the process of repair is not complicated
 30663	by infection with micro-organisms, there is no interference with the
 30664	general health of the patient. The temperature remains normal; the
 30665	circulatory, gastro-intestinal, nervous, and other functions are
 30666	undisturbed; locally, the part is cool, of natural colour and free from
 30667	pain.
 30668	
 30669	#Modifications of the Process of Repair.#--The process of repair by
 30670	primary union, above described, is to be looked upon as the type of all
 30671	reparative processes, such modifications as are met with depending
 30672	merely upon incidental differences in the conditions present, such as
 30673	loss of tissue, infection by micro-organisms, etc.
 30674	
 30675	_Repair after Loss or Destruction of Tissue._--When the edges of a wound
 30676	cannot be approximated either because tissue has been lost, for example
 30677	in excising a tumour or because a drainage tube or gauze packing has
 30678	been necessary, a greater amount of granulation tissue is required to
 30679	fill the gap, but the process is essentially the same as in the ideal
 30680	method of repair.
 30681	
 30682	The raw surface is first covered by a layer of coagulated blood and
 30683	fibrin. An extensive new formation of capillary loops and fibroblasts
 30684	takes place towards the free surface, and goes on until the gap is
 30685	filled by a fine velvet-like mass of granulation tissue. This
 30686	granulation tissue is gradually replaced by young cicatricial tissue,
 30687	and the surface is covered by the ingrowth of epithelium from the edges.
 30688	
 30689	This modification of the reparative process can be best studied
 30690	clinically in a recent wound which has been packed with gauze. When the
 30691	plug is introduced, the walls of the cavity consist of raw tissue with
 30692	numerous oozing blood vessels. On removing the packing on the fifth or
 30693	sixth day, the surface is found to be covered with minute, red,
 30694	papillary granulations, which are beginning to fill up the cavity. At
 30695	the edges the epithelium has proliferated and is covering over the newly
 30696	formed granulation tissue. As lymph and leucocytes escape from the
 30697	exposed surface there is a certain amount of serous or sero-purulent
 30698	discharge. On examining the wound at intervals of a few days, it is
 30699	found that the granulation tissue gradually increases in amount till the
 30700	gap is completely filled up, and that coincidently the epithelium
 30701	spreads in and covers over its surface. In course of time the epithelium
 30702	thickens, and as the granulation tissue is slowly replaced by young
 30703	cicatricial tissue, which has a peculiar tendency to contract and so to
 30704	obliterate the blood vessels in it, the scar that is left becomes
 30705	smooth, pale, and depressed. This method of healing is sometimes spoken
 30706	of as "healing by granulation"--although, as we have seen, it is by
 30707	granulation that all repair takes place.
 30708	
 30709	_Healing by Union of two Granulating Surfaces._--In gaping wounds union
 30710	is sometimes obtained by bringing the two surfaces into apposition after
 30711	each has become covered with healthy granulations. The exudate on the
 30712	surfaces causes them to adhere, capillary loops pass from one to the
 30713	other, and their final fusion takes place by the further development of
 30714	granulation and cicatricial tissue.
 30715	
 30716	_Reunion of Parts entirely Separated from the Body._--Small portions of
 30717	tissue, such as the end of a finger, the tip of the nose or a portion of
 30718	the external ear, accidentally separated from the body, if accurately
 30719	replaced and fixed in position, occasionally adhere by primary union.
 30720	
 30721	In the course of operations also, portions of skin, fascia, or bone, or
 30722	even a complete joint may be transplanted, and unite by primary union.
 30723	
 30724	_Healing under a Scab._--When a small superficial wound is exposed to
 30725	the air, the blood and serum exuded on its surface may dry and form a
 30726	hard crust or _scab_, which serves to protect the surface from external
 30727	irritation in the same way as would a dry pad of sterilised gauze. Under
 30728	this scab the formation of granulation tissue, its transformation into
 30729	cicatricial tissue, and the growth of epithelium on the surface, go on
 30730	until in the course of time the crust separates, leaving a scar.
 30731	
 30732	_Healing by Blood-clot._--In subcutaneous wounds, for example tenotomy,
 30733	in amputation wounds, and in wounds made in excising tumours or in
 30734	operating upon bones, the space left between the divided tissues becomes
 30735	filled with blood-clot, which acts as a temporary scaffolding in which
 30736	granulation tissue is built up. Capillary loops grow into the coagulum,
 30737	and migrated leucocytes from the adjacent blood vessels destroy the red
 30738	corpuscles, and are in turn disposed of by the developing fibroblasts,
 30739	which by their growth and proliferation fill up the gap with young
 30740	connective tissue. It will be evident that this process only differs
 30741	from healing by primary union in the _amount_ of blood-clot that is
 30742	present.
 30743	
 30744	_Presence of a Foreign Body._--When an aseptic foreign body is present
 30745	in the tissues, _e.g._ a piece of unabsorbable chromicised catgut, the
 30746	healing process may be modified. After primary union has taken place the
 30747	scar may broaden, become raised above the surface, and assume a
 30748	bluish-brown colour; the epidermis gradually thins and gives way,
 30749	revealing the softened portion of catgut, which can be pulled out in
 30750	pieces, after which the wound rapidly heals and resumes a normal
 30751	appearance.
 30752	
 30753	
 30754	REPAIR IN INDIVIDUAL TISSUES
 30755	
 30756	_Skin and Connective Tissue._--The mode of regeneration of these tissues
 30757	under aseptic conditions has already been described as the type of ideal
 30758	repair. In highly vascular parts, such as the face, the reparative
 30759	process goes on with great rapidity, and even extensive wounds may be
 30760	firmly united in from three to five days. Where the anastomosis is less
 30761	free the process is more prolonged. The more highly organised elements
 30762	of the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands,
 30763	are imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and
 30764	hairless.
 30765	
 30766	_Epithelium._--Epithelium is only reproduced from pre-existing
 30767	epithelium, and, as a rule, from one of a similar type, although
 30768	metaplastic transformation of cells of one kind of epithelium into
 30769	another kind can take place. Thus a granulating surface may be covered
 30770	entirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins;
 30771	or islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat
 30772	glands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw
 30773	area. Such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of
 30774	loose epithelial cells from the edges. Even the fluid from a blister, in
 30775	virtue of the isolated cells of the rete Malpighii which it contains, is
 30776	capable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface. Hairs
 30777	and nails may be completely regenerated if a sufficient amount of the
 30778	hair follicles or of the nail matrix has escaped destruction. The
 30779	epithelium of a mucous membrane is regenerated in the same way as that
 30780	on a cutaneous surface.
 30781	
 30782	Epithelial cells have the power of living for some time after being
 30783	separated from their normal surroundings, and of growing again when once
 30784	more placed in favourable circumstances. On this fact the practice of
 30785	skin grafting is based (p. 11).
 30786	
 30787	_Cartilage._--When an articular cartilage is divided by incision or by
 30788	being implicated in a fracture involving the articular end of a bone, it
 30789	is repaired by ordinary cicatricial fibrous tissue derived from the
 30790	proliferating cells of the perichondrium. Cartilage being a non-vascular
 30791	tissue, the reparative process goes on slowly, and it may be many weeks
 30792	before it is complete.
 30793	
 30794	It is possible for a metaplastic transformation of connective-tissue
 30795	cells into cartilage cells to take place, the characteristic hyaline
 30796	matrix being secreted by the new cells. This is sometimes observed as an
 30797	intermediary stage in the healing of fractures, especially in young
 30798	bones. It may also take place in the regeneration of lost portions of
 30799	cartilage, provided the new tissue is so situated as to constitute part
 30800	of a joint and to be subjected to pressure by an opposing cartilaginous
 30801	surface. This is illustrated by what takes place after excision of
 30802	joints where it is desired to restore the function of the articulation.
 30803	By carrying out movements between the constituent parts, the fibrous
 30804	tissue covering the ends of the bones becomes moulded into shape, its
 30805	cells take on the characters of cartilage cells, and, forming a matrix,
 30806	so develop a new cartilage.
 30807	
 30808	Conversely, it is observed that when articular cartilage is no longer
 30809	subjected to pressure by an opposing cartilage, it tends to be
 30810	transformed into fibrous tissue, as may be seen in deformities attended
 30811	with displacement of articular surfaces, such as hallux valgus and
 30812	club-foot.
 30813	
 30814	After fractures of costal cartilage or of the cartilages of the larynx
 30815	the cicatricial tissue may be ultimately replaced by bone.
 30816	
 30817	_Tendons._--When a tendon is divided, for example by subcutaneous
 30818	tenotomy, the end nearer the muscle fibres is drawn away from the other,
 30819	leaving a gap which is speedily filled by blood-clot. In the course of a
 30820	few days this clot becomes permeated by granulation tissue, the
 30821	fibroblasts of which are derived from the sheath of the tendon, the
 30822	surrounding connective tissue, and probably also from the divided ends
 30823	of the tendon itself. These fibroblasts ultimately develop into typical
 30824	tendon cells, and the fibres which they form constitute the new tendon
 30825	fibres. Under aseptic conditions repair is complete in from two to three
 30826	weeks. In the course of the reparative process the tendon and its sheath
 30827	may become adherent, which leads to impaired movement and stiffness. If
 30828	the ends of an accidentally divided tendon are at once brought into
 30829	accurate apposition and secured by sutures, they unite directly with a
 30830	minimum amount of scar tissue, and function is perfectly restored.
 30831	
 30832	_Muscle._--Unstriped muscle does not seem to be capable of being
 30833	regenerated to any but a moderate degree. If the ends of a divided
 30834	striped muscle are at once brought into apposition by stitches, primary
 30835	union takes place with a minimum of intervening fibrous tissue. The
 30836	nuclei of the muscle fibres in close proximity to this young cicatricial
 30837	tissue proliferate, and a few new muscle fibres may be developed, but
 30838	any gross loss of muscular tissue is replaced by a fibrous cicatrix. It
 30839	would appear that portions of muscle transplanted from animals to fill
 30840	up gaps in human muscle are similarly replaced by fibrous tissue. When a
 30841	muscle is paralysed from loss of its nerve supply and undergoes complete
 30842	degeneration, it is not capable of being regenerated, even should the
 30843	integrity of the nerve be restored, and so its function is permanently
 30844	lost.
 30845	
 30846	_Secretory Glands._--The regeneration of secretory glands is usually
 30847	incomplete, cicatricial tissue taking the place of the glandular
 30848	substance which has been destroyed. In wounds of the liver, for example,
 30849	the gap is filled by fibrous tissue, but towards the periphery of the
 30850	
 30851	wound the liver cells proliferate and a certain amount of regeneration
 30852	takes place. In the kidney also, repair mainly takes place by
 30853	cicatricial tissue, and although a few collecting tubules may be
 30854	reformed, no regeneration of secreting tissue takes place. After the
 30855	operation of decapsulation of the kidney a new capsule is formed, and
 30856	during the process young blood vessels permeate the superficial parts
 30857	of the kidney and temporarily increase its blood supply, but in the
 30858	consolidation of the new fibrous tissue these vessels are ultimately
 30859	obliterated. This does not prove that the operation is useless, as the
 30860	temporary improvement of the circulation in the kidney may serve to tide
 30861	the patient over a critical period of renal insufficiency.
 30862	
 30863	_Stomach and Intestine._--Provided the peritoneal surfaces are
 30864	accurately apposed, wounds of the stomach and intestine heal with great
 30865	rapidity. Within a few hours the peritoneal surfaces are glued together
 30866	by a thin layer of fibrin and leucocytes, which is speedily organised
 30867	and replaced by fibrous tissue. Fibrous tissue takes the place of the
 30868	muscular elements, which are not regenerated. The mucous lining is
 30869	restored by ingrowth from the margins, and there is evidence that some
 30870	of the secreting glands may be reproduced.
 30871	
 30872	Hollow viscera, like the oesophagus and urinary bladder, in so far
 30873	as they are not covered by peritoneum, heal less rapidly.
 30874	
 30875	_Nerve Tissues._--There is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of
 30876	the tissues of the brain or spinal cord in man ever takes place. Any
 30877	loss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue.
 30878	
 30879	The repair of _Bone_, _Blood Vessels_, and _Peripheral Nerves_ is more
 30880	conveniently considered in the chapters dealing with these structures.
 30881	
 30882	#Rate of Healing.#--While the rate at which wounds heal is remarkably
 30883	constant there are certain factors that influence it in one direction or
 30884	the other. Healing is more rapid when the edges are in contact, when
 30885	there is a minimum amount of blood-clot between them, when the patient
 30886	is in normal health and the vitality of the tissues has not been
 30887	impaired. Wounds heal slightly more quickly in the young than in the
 30888	old, although the difference is so small that it can only be
 30889	demonstrated by the most careful observations.
 30890	
 30891	Certain tissues take longer to heal than others: for example, a fracture
 30892	of one of the larger long bones takes about six weeks to unite, and
 30893	divided nerve trunks take much longer--about a year.
 30894	
 30895	Wounds of certain parts of the body heal more quickly than others: those
 30896	of the scalp, face, and neck, for example, heal more quickly than those
 30897	over the buttock or sacrum, probably because of their greater
 30898	vascularity.
 30899	
 30900	The extent of the wound influences the rate of healing; it is only
 30901	
 30902	natural that a long and deep wound should take longer to heal than a
 30903	short and superficial one, because there is so much more work to be
 30904	done in the conversion of blood-clot into granulation tissue, and this
 30905	again into scar tissue that will be strong enough to stand the strain on
 30906	the edges of the wound.
 30907	
 30908	
 30909	THE TRANSPLANTATION OR GRAFTING OF TISSUES
 30910	
 30911	Conditions are not infrequently met with in which healing is promoted
 30912	and restoration of function made possible by the transference of a
 30913	portion of tissue from one part of the body to another; the tissue
 30914	transferred is known as the _graft_ or the _transplant_. The simplest
 30915	example of grafting is the transplantation of skin.
 30916	
 30917	In order that the graft may survive and have a favourable chance of
 30918	"taking," as it is called, the transplanted tissue must retain its
 30919	vitality until it has formed an organic connection with the tissue in
 30920	which it is placed, so that it may derive the necessary nourishment from
 30921	its new bed. When these conditions are fulfilled the tissues of the
 30922	graft continue to proliferate, producing new tissue elements to replace
 30923	those that are lost and making it possible for the graft to become
 30924	incorporated with the tissue with which it is in contact.
 30925	
 30926	Dead tissue, on the other hand, can do neither of these things; it is
 30927	only capable of acting as a model, or, at the most, as a scaffolding for
 30928	such mobile tissue elements as may be derived from, the parent tissue
 30929	with which the graft is in contact: a portion of sterilised marine
 30930	sponge, for example, may be observed to become permeated with
 30931	granulation tissue when it is embedded in the tissues.
 30932	
 30933	A successful graft of living tissue is not only capable of regeneration,
 30934	but it acquires a system of lymph and blood vessels, so that in time it
 30935	bleeds when cut into, and is permeated by new nerve fibres spreading in
 30936	from the periphery towards the centre.
 30937	
 30938	It is instructive to associate the period of survival of the different
 30939	tissues of the body after death, with their capacity of being used for
 30940	grafting purposes; the higher tissues such as those of the central
 30941	nervous system and highly specialised glandular tissues like those of
 30942	the kidney lose their vitality quickly after death and are therefore
 30943	useless for grafting; connective tissues, on the other hand, such as
 30944	fat, cartilage, and bone retain their vitality for several hours after
 30945	death, so that when they are transplanted, they readily "take" and do
 30946	all that is required of them: the same is true of the skin and its
 30947	appendages.
 30948	
 30949	_Sources of Grafts._--It is convenient to differentiate between
 30950	_autoplastic_ grafts, that is those derived from the same individual;
 30951	_homoplastic_ grafts, derived from another animal of the same species;
 30952	and _heteroplastic_ grafts, derived from an animal of another species.
 30953	Other conditions being equal, the prospects of success are greatest with
 30954	autoplastic grafts, and these are therefore preferred whenever possible.
 30955	
 30956	There are certain details making for success that merit attention: the
 30957	graft must not be roughly handled or allowed to dry, or be subjected to
 30958	chemical irritation; it must be brought into accurate contact with the
 30959	new soil, no blood-clot intervening between the two, no movement of the
 30960	one upon the other should be possible and all infection must be
 30961	excluded; it will be observed that these are exactly the same conditions
 30962	that permit of the primary healing of wounds, with which of course the
 30963	healing of grafts is exactly comparable.
 30964	
 30965	_Preservation of Tissues for Grafting._--It was at one time believed
 30966	that tissues might be taken from the operating theatre and kept in cold
 30967	storage until they were required. It is now agreed that tissues which
 30968	have been separated from the body for some time inevitably lose their
 30969	vitality, become incapable of regeneration, and are therefore unsuited
 30970	for grafting purposes. If it is intended to preserve a portion of tissue
 30971	for future grafting, it should be embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of
 30972	the abdominal wall until it is wanted; this has been carried out with
 30973	portions of costal cartilage and of bone.
 30974	
 30975	
 30976	INDIVIDUAL TISSUES AS GRAFTS
 30977	
 30978	#The Blood# lends itself in an ideal manner to transplantation, or, as
 30979	it has long been called, _transfusion_. Being always a homoplastic
 30980	transfer, the new blood is not always tolerated by the old, in which
 30981	case biochemical changes occur, resulting in haemolysis, which
 30982	corresponds to the disintegration of other unsuccessful homoplastic
 30983	grafts. (See article on Transfusion, _Op. Surg._, p. 37.)
 30984	
 30985	#The Skin.#--The skin was the first tissue to be used for grafting
 30986	purposes, and it is still employed with greater frequency than any
 30987	other, as lesions causing defects of skin are extremely common and
 30988	without the aid of grafts are tedious in healing.
 30989	
 30990	Skin grafts may be applied to a raw surface or to one that is covered
 30991	with granulations.
 30992	
 30993	_Skin grafting of raw surfaces_ is commonly indicated after operations
 30994	for malignant disease in which considerable areas of skin must be
 30995	sacrificed, and after accidents, such as avulsion of the scalp by
 30996	machinery.
 30997	
 30998	_Skin grafting of granulating surfaces_ is chiefly employed to promote
 30999	healing in the large defects of skin caused by severe burns; the
 31000	grafting is carried out when the surface is covered by a uniform layer
 31001	of healthy granulations and before the inevitable contraction of scar
 31002	tissue makes itself manifest. Before applying the grafts it is usual to
 31003	scrape away the granulations until the young fibrous tissue underneath
 31004	is exposed, but, if the granulations are healthy and can be rendered
 31005	aseptic, the grafts may be placed on them directly.
 31006	
 31007	If it is decided to scrape away the granulations, the oozing must be
 31008	arrested by pressure with a pad of gauze, a sheet of dental rubber or
 31009	green protective is placed next the raw surface to prevent the gauze
 31010	adhering and starting the bleeding afresh when it is removed.
 31011	
 31012	#Methods of Skin-Grafting.#--Two methods are employed: one in which the
 31013	epidermis is mainly or exclusively employed--epidermis or epithelial
 31014	grafting; the other, in which the graft consists of the whole thickness
 31015	of the true skin--cutis-grafting.
 31016	
 31017	_Epidermis or Epithelial Grafting._--The method introduced by the late
 31018	Professor Thiersch of Leipsic is that almost universally practised. It
 31019	consists in transplanting strips of epidermis shaved from the surface of
 31020	the skin, the razor passing through the tips of the papillae, which
 31021	appear as tiny red points yielding a moderate ooze of blood.
 31022	
 31023	The strips are obtained from the front and lateral aspects of the thigh
 31024	or upper arm, the skin in those regions being pliable and comparatively
 31025	free from hairs.
 31026	
 31027	They are cut with a sharp hollow-ground razor or with Thiersch's
 31028	grafting knife, the blade of which is rinsed in alcohol and kept
 31029	moistened with warm saline solution. The cutting is made easier if the
 31030	skin is well stretched and kept flat and perfectly steady, the
 31031	operator's left hand exerting traction on the skin behind, the hands of
 31032	the assistant on the skin in front, one above and the other below the
 31033	seat of operation. To ensure uniform strips being cut, the razor is kept
 31034	parallel with the surface and used with a short, rapid, sawing movement,
 31035	so that, with a little practice, grafts six or eight inches long by one
 31036	or two inches broad can readily be cut. The patient is given a general
 31037	anaesthetic, or regional anaesthesia is obtained by injections of a
 31038	solution of one per cent. novocain into the line of the lateral and
 31039	middle cutaneous nerves; the disinfection of the skin is carried out on
 31040	the usual lines, any chemical agent being finally got rid of, however,
 31041	by means of alcohol followed by saline solution.
 31042	
 31043	The strips of epidermis wrinkle up on the knife and are directly
 31044	transferred to the surface, for which they should be made to form a
 31045	complete carpet, slightly overlapping the edges of the area and of one
 31046	another; some blunt instrument is used to straighten out the strips,
 31047	which are then subjected to firm pressure with a pad of gauze to express
 31048	blood and air-bells and to ensure accurate contact, for this must be as
 31049	close as that between a postage stamp and the paper to which it is
 31050	affixed.
 31051	
 31052	As a dressing for the grafted area and of that also from which the
 31053	grafts have been taken, gauze soaked in _liquid paraffin_--the patent
 31054	variety known as _ambrine_ is excellent--appears to be the best; the
 31055	gauze should be moistened every other day or so with fresh paraffin, so
 31056	that, at the end of a week, when the grafts should have united, the
 31057	gauze can be removed without risk of detaching them. _Dental wax_ is
 31058	another useful type of dressing; as is also _picric acid_ solution. Over
 31059	the gauze, there is applied a thick layer of cotton wool, and the whole
 31060	dressing is kept in place by a firmly applied bandage, and in the case
 31061	of the limbs some form of splint should be added to prevent movement.
 31062	
 31063	A dressing may be dispensed with altogether, the grafts being protected
 31064	by a wire cage such as is used after vaccination, but they tend to dry
 31065	up and come to resemble a scab.
 31066	
 31067	When the grafts have healed, it is well to protect them from injury and
 31068	to prevent them drying up and cracking by the liberal application of
 31069	lanoline or vaseline.
 31070	
 31071	The new skin is at first insensitive and is fixed to the underlying
 31072	connective tissue or bone, but in course of time (from six weeks
 31073	onwards) sensation returns and the formation of elastic tissue beneath
 31074	renders the skin pliant and movable so that it can be pinched up between
 31075	the finger and thumb.
 31076	
 31077	_Reverdin's_ method consists in planting out pieces of skin not bigger
 31078	than a pin-head over a granulating surface. It is seldom employed.
 31079	
 31080	_Grafts of the Cutis Vera._--Grafts consisting of the entire thickness
 31081	of the true skin were specially advocated by Wolff and are often
 31082	associated with his name. They should be cut oval or spindle-shaped, to
 31083	facilitate the approximation of the edges of the resulting wound. The
 31084	graft should be cut to the exact size of the surface it is to cover;
 31085	Gillies believes that tension of the graft favours its taking. These
 31086	grafts may be placed either on a fresh raw surface or on healthy
 31087	granulations. It is sometimes an advantage to stitch them in position,
 31088	especially on the face. The dressing and the after-treatment are the
 31089	same as in epidermis grafting.
 31090	
 31091	There is a degree of uncertainty about the graft retaining its vitality
 31092	long enough to permit of its deriving the necessary nourishment from its
 31093	new surroundings; in a certain number of cases the flap dies and is
 31094	thrown off as a slough--moist or dry according to the presence or
 31095	absence of septic infection.
 31096	
 31097	The technique for cutis-grafting must be without a flaw, and the asepsis
 31098	absolute; there must not only be a complete absence of movement, but
 31099	there must be no traction on the flap that will endanger its blood
 31100	supply.
 31101	
 31102	Owing to the uncertainty in the results of cutis-grafting the
 31103	_two-stage_ or _indirect method_ has been introduced, and its almost
 31104	uniform success has led to its sphere of application being widely
 31105	extended. The flap is raised as in the direct method but is left
 31106	attached at one of its margins for a period ranging from 14 to 21 days
 31107	until its blood supply from its new bed is assured; the detachment is
 31108	then made complete. The blood supply of the proposed flap may influence
 31109	its selection and the way in which it is fashioned; for example, a flap
 31110	cut from the side of the head to fill a defect in the cheek, having in
 31111	its margin of attachment or pedicle the superficial temporal artery, is
 31112	more likely to take than a flap cut with its base above.
 31113	
 31114	Another modification is to raise the flap but leave it connected at both
 31115	ends like the piers of a bridge; this method is well suited to defects
 31116	of skin on the dorsum of the fingers, hand and forearm, the bridge of
 31117	skin is raised from the abdominal wall and the hand is passed beneath it
 31118	and securely fixed in position; after an interval of 14 to 21 days, when
 31119	the flap is assured of its blood supply, the piers of the bridge are
 31120	divided (Fig. 1). With undermining it is usually easy to bring the
 31121	edges of the gap in the abdominal wall together, even in children; the
 31122	skin flap on the dorsum of the hand appears rather thick and
 31123	prominent--almost like the pad of a boxing-glove--for some time, but
 31124	the restoration of function in the capacity to flex the fingers is
 31125	gratifying in the extreme.
 31126	
 31127	[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Ulcer of back of Hand covered by flap of skin
 31128	raised from anterior abdominal wall. The lateral edges of the flap are
 31129	divided after the graft has adhered.]
 31130	
 31131	The indirect element of this method of skin-grafting may be carried
 31132	still further by transferring the flap of skin first to one part of the
 31133	body and then, after it has taken, transferring it to a third part.
 31134	Gillies has especially developed this method in the remedying of
 31135	deformities of the face caused by gunshot wounds and by petrol burns in
 31136	air-men. A rectangular flap of skin is marked out in the neck and chest,
 31137	the lateral margins of the flap are raised sufficiently to enable them
 31138	to be brought together so as to form a tube of skin: after the
 31139	circulation has been restored, the lower end of the tube is detached and
 31140	is brought up to the lip or cheek, or eyelid, where it is wanted; when
 31141	this end has derived its new blood supply, the other end is detached
 31142	from the neck and brought up to where it is wanted. In this way, skin
 31143	from the chest may be brought up to form a new forehead and eyelids.
 31144	
 31145	Grafts of _mucous membrane_ are used to cover defects in the lip, cheek,
 31146	and conjunctiva. The technique is similar to that employed in
 31147	skin-grafting; the sources of mucous membrane are limited and the
 31148	element of septic infection cannot always be excluded.
 31149	
 31150	_Fat._--Adipose tissue has a low vitality, but it is easily retained and
 31151	it readily lends itself to transplantation. Portions of fat are often
 31152	obtainable at operations--from the omentum, for example, otherwise the
 31153	subcutaneous fat of the buttock is the most accessible; it may be
 31154	employed to fill up cavities of all kinds in order to obtain more rapid
 31155	and sounder healing and also to remedy deformity, as in filling up a
 31156	depression in the cheek or forehead. It is ultimately converted into
 31157	ordinary connective tissue _pari passu_ with the absorption of the fat.
 31158	
 31159	The _fascia lata of the thigh_ is widely and successfully used as a
 31160	graft to fill defects in the dura mater, and interposed between the
 31161	bones of a joint--if the articular cartilage has been destroyed--to
 31162	prevent the occurrence of ankylosis.
 31163	
 31164	The _peritoneum_ of hydrocele and hernial sacs and of the omentum
 31165	readily lends itself to transplantation.
 31166	
 31167	_Cartilage and bone_, next to skin, are the tissues most frequently
 31168	employed for grafting purposes; their sphere of action is so extensive
 31169	and includes so much of technical detail in their employment, that they
 31170	will be considered later with the surgery of the bones and joints and
 31171	with the methods of re-forming the nose.
 31172	
 31173	_Tendons and blood vessels_ readily lend themselves to transplantation
 31174	and will also be referred to later.
 31175	
 31176	_Muscle and nerve_, on the other hand, do not retain their vitality when
 31177	severed from their surroundings and do not functionate as grafts except
 31178	for their connective-tissue elements, which it goes without saying are
 31179	more readily obtainable from other sources.
 31180	
 31181	Portions of the _ovary_ and of the _thyreoid_ have been successfully
 31182	transplanted into the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the abdominal wall
 31183	by Tuffier and others. In these new surroundings, the ovary or thyreoid
 31184	is vascularised and has been shown to functionate, but there is not
 31185	sufficient regeneration of the essential tissue elements to "carry on";
 31186	the secreting tissue is gradually replaced by connective tissue and the
 31187	special function comes to an end. Even such temporary function may,
 31188	however, tide a patient over a difficult period.

 31206	
 31207	In the management of wounds and other surgical conditions it is
 31208	necessary to eliminate various extraneous influences which tend to delay
 31209	or arrest the natural process of repair.
 31210	
 31211	Of these, one of the most important is undue movement of the affected
 31212	part. "The first and great requisite for the restoration of injured
 31213	parts is _rest_," said John Hunter; and physiological and mechanical
 31214	rest as the chief of natural therapeutic agents was the theme of John
 31215	Hilton's classical work--_Rest and Pain_. In this connection it must be
 31216	understood that "rest" implies more than the mere state of physical
 31217	repose: all physiological as well as mechanical function must be
 31218	prevented as far as is possible. For instance, the constituent bones of
 31219	a joint affected with tuberculosis must be controlled by splints or
 31220	other appliances so that no movement can take place between them, and
 31221	the limb may not be used for any purpose; physiological rest may be
 31222	secured to an inflamed colon by making an artificial anus in the caecum;
 31223	the activity of a diseased kidney may be diminished by regulating the
 31224	quantity and quality of the fluids taken by the patient.
 31225	
 31226	Another source of interference with repair in wounds is _irritation_,
 31227	either by mechanical agents such as rough, unsuitable dressings,
 31228	bandages, or ill-fitting splints; or by chemical agents in the form of
 31229	strong lotions or other applications.
 31230	
 31231	An _unhealthy or devitalised condition of the patient's tissues_ also
 31232	hinders the reparative process. Bruised or lacerated skin heals less
 31233	kindly than skin cut with a smooth, sharp instrument; and persistent
 31234	
 31235	venous congestion of a part, such as occurs, for example, in the leg
 31236	when the veins are varicose, by preventing the access of healthy blood,
 31237	tends to delay the healing of open wounds. The existence of grave
 31238	constitutional disease, such as Bright's disease, diabetes, syphilis,
 31239	scurvy, or alcoholism, also impedes healing.
 31240	
 31241	Infection by disease-producing micro-organisms or _pathogenic bacteria_
 31242	is, however, the most potent factor in disturbing the natural process of
 31243	repair in wounds.
 31244	
 31245	
 31246	SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY
 31247	
 31248	The influence of micro-organisms in the causation of disease, and the
 31249	role played by them in interfering with the natural process of repair,
 31250	are so important that the science of applied bacteriology has now come
 31251	to dominate every department of surgery, and it is from the standpoint
 31252	of bacteriology that nearly all surgical questions have to be
 31253	considered.
 31254	
 31255	The term _sepsis_ as now used in clinical surgery no longer retains its
 31256	original meaning as synonymous with "putrefaction," but is employed to
 31257	denote all conditions in which bacterial infection has taken place, and
 31258	more particularly those in which pyogenic bacteria are present. In the
 31259	same way the term _aseptic_ conveys the idea of freedom from all forms
 31260	of bacteria, putrefactive or otherwise; and the term _antiseptic_ is
 31261	used to denote a power of counteracting bacteria and their products.
 31262	
 31263	#General Characters of Bacteria.#--A _bacterium_ consists of a finely
 31264	granular mass of protoplasm, enclosed in a thin gelatinous envelope.
 31265	Many forms are motile--some in virtue of fine thread-like flagella, and
 31266	others through contractility of the protoplasm. The great majority
 31267	multiply by simple fission, each parent cell giving rise to two daughter
 31268	cells, and this process goes on with extraordinary rapidity. Other
 31269	varieties, particularly bacilli, are propagated by the formation of
 31270	_spores_. A spore is a minute mass of protoplasm surrounded by a dense,
 31271	tough membrane, developed in the interior of the parent cell. Spores are
 31272	remarkable for their tenacity of life, and for the resistance they offer
 31273	to the action of heat and chemical germicides.
 31274	
 31275	Bacteria are most conveniently classified according to their shape. Thus
 31276	we recognise (1) those that are globular--_cocci_; (2) those that
 31277	resemble a rod--_bacilli_; (3) the spiral or wavy forms--_spirilla_.
 31278	
 31279	_Cocci_ or _micrococci_ are minute round bodies, averaging about 1 u in
 31280	diameter. The great majority are non-motile. They multiply by fission;
 31281	and when they divide in such a way that the resulting cells remain in
 31282	pairs, are called _diplococci_, of which the bacteria of gonorrhoea and
 31283	pneumonia are examples (Fig. 5). When they divide irregularly, and form
 31284	grape-like bunches, they are known as _staphylococci_, and to this
 31285	
 31286	variety the commonest pyogenic or pus-forming organisms belong (Fig. 2).
 31287	When division takes place only in one axis, so that long chains are
 31288	formed, the term _streptococcus_ is applied (Fig. 3). Streptococci are
 31289	met with in erysipelas and various other inflammatory and suppurative
 31290	processes of a spreading character.
 31291	
 31292	_Bacilli_ are rod-shaped bacteria, usually at least twice as long as
 31293	they are broad (Fig. 4). Some multiply by fission, others by
 31294	sporulation. Some forms are motile, others are non-motile. Tuberculosis,
 31295	tetanus, anthrax, and many other surgical diseases are due to different
 31296	forms of bacilli.
 31297	
 31298	_Spirilla_ are long, slender, thread-like cells, more or less spiral or
 31299	wavy. Some move by a screw-like contraction of the protoplasm, some by
 31300	flagellae. The spirochaete associated with syphilis (Fig. 36) is the most
 31301	important member of this group.
 31302	
 31303	#Conditions of Bacterial Life.#--Bacteria require for their growth and
 31304	development a suitable food-supply in the form of proteins,
 31305	carbohydrates, and salts of calcium and potassium which they break up
 31306	into simpler elements. An alkaline medium favours bacterial growth; and
 31307	moisture is a necessary condition; spores, however, can survive the want
 31308	of water for much longer periods than fully developed bacteria. The
 31309	necessity for oxygen varies in different species. Those that require
 31310	oxygen are known as _aerobic bacilli_ or _aerobes_; those that cannot
 31311	live in the presence of oxygen are spoken of as _anaerobes_. The great
 31312	majority of bacteria, however, while they prefer to have oxygen, are
 31313	able to live without it, and are called _facultative anaerobes_.
 31314	
 31315	The most suitable temperature for bacterial life is from 95 o to 102 o F.,
 31316	roughly that of the human body. Extreme or prolonged cold paralyses but
 31317	does not kill micro-organisms. Few, however, survive being raised to a
 31318	temperature of 134 1/2 o F. Boiling for ten to twenty minutes will kill all
 31319	bacteria, and the great majority of spores. Steam applied in an
 31320	autoclave under a pressure of two atmospheres destroys even the most
 31321	resistant spores in a few minutes. Direct sunlight, electric light, or
 31322	even diffuse daylight, is inimical to the growth of bacteria, as are
 31323	also Rontgen rays and radium emanations.
 31324	
 31325	#Pathogenic Properties of Bacteria.#--We are now only concerned with
 31326	pathogenic bacteria--that is, bacteria capable of producing disease in
 31327	the human subject. This capacity depends upon two sets of factors--(1)
 31328	certain features peculiar to the invading bacteria, and (2) others
 31329	peculiar to the host. Many bacteria have only the power of living upon
 31330	dead matter, and are known as _saphrophytes_. Such as do nourish in
 31331	living tissue are, by distinction, known as _parasites_. The power a
 31332	given parasitic micro-organism has of multiplying in the body and giving
 31333	rise to disease is spoken of as its _virulence_, and this varies not
 31334	only with different species, but in the same species at different times
 31335	and under varying circumstances. The actual number of organisms
 31336	introduced is also an important factor in determining their pathogenic
 31337	power. Healthy tissues can resist the invasion of a certain number of
 31338	bacteria of a given species, but when that number is exceeded, the
 31339	organisms get the upper hand and disease results. When the organisms
 31340	gain access directly to the blood-stream, as a rule they produce their
 31341	effects more certainly and with greater intensity than when they are
 31342	introduced into the tissues.
 31343	
 31344	Further, the virulence of an organism is modified by the condition of
 31345	the patient into whose tissues it is introduced. So long as a person is
 31346	in good health, the tissues are able to resist the attacks of moderate
 31347	numbers of most bacteria. Any lowering of the vitality of the
 31348	individual, however, either locally or generally, at once renders him
 31349	more susceptible to infection. Thus bruised or torn tissue is much more
 31350	liable to infection with pus-producing organisms than tissues clean-cut
 31351	with a knife; also, after certain diseases, the liability to infection
 31352	by the organisms of diphtheria, pneumonia, or erysipelas is much
 31353	increased. Even such slight depression of vitality as results from
 31354	bodily fatigue, or exposure to cold and damp, may be sufficient to turn
 31355	the scale in the battle between the tissues and the bacteria. Age is an
 31356	important factor in regard to the action of certain bacteria. Young
 31357	subjects are attacked by diphtheria, tuberculosis, acute osteomyelitis,
 31358	and some other diseases with greater frequency and severity than those
 31359	of more advanced years.
 31360	
 31361	In different races, localities, environment, and seasons, the pathogenic
 31362	powers of certain organisms, such as those of erysipelas, diphtheria,
 31363	and acute osteomyelitis, vary considerably.
 31364	
 31365	There is evidence that a _mixed infection_--that is, the introduction of
 31366	more than one species of organism, for example, the tubercle bacillus
 31367	and a pyogenic staphylococcus--increases the severity of the resulting
 31368	disease. If one of the varieties gain the ascendancy, the poisons
 31369	produced by the others so devitalise the tissue cells, and diminish
 31370	their power of resistance, that the virulence of the most active
 31371	organisms is increased. On the other hand, there is reason to believe
 31372	that the products of certain organisms antagonise one another--for
 31373	example, an attack of erysipelas may effect the cure of a patch of
 31374	tuberculous lupus.
 31375	
 31376	Lastly, in patients suffering from chronic wasting diseases, bacteria
 31377	may invade the internal organs by the blood-stream in enormous numbers
 31378	and with great rapidity, during the period of extreme debility which
 31379	shortly precedes death. The discovery of such collections of organisms
 31380	on post-mortem examination may lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn
 31381	as to the cause of death.
 31382	
 31383	#Results of Bacterial Growth.#--Some organisms, such as those of tetanus
 31384	and erysipelas, and certain of the pyogenic bacteria, show little
 31385	tendency to pass far beyond the point at which they gain an entrance to
 31386	the body. Others, on the contrary--for example, the tubercle bacillus
 31387	and the organism of acute osteomyelitis--although frequently remaining
 31388	localised at the seat of inoculation, tend to pass to distant parts,
 31389	lodging in the capillaries of joints, bones, kidney, or lungs, and there
 31390	producing their deleterious effects.
 31391	
 31392	In the human subject, multiplication in the blood-stream does not occur
 31393	to any great extent. In some general acute pyogenic infections, such as
 31394	osteomyelitis, cellulitis, etc., pure cultures of staphylococci or of
 31395	streptococci may be obtained from the blood. In pneumococcal and typhoid
 31396	infections, also, the organisms may be found in the blood.
 31397	
 31398	It is by the vital changes they bring about in the parts where they
 31399	settle that micro-organisms disturb the health of the patient. In
 31400	deriving nourishment from the complex organic compounds in which they
 31401	nourish, the organisms evolve, probably by means of a ferment, certain
 31402	chemical products of unknown composition, but probably colloidal in
 31403	nature, and known as _toxins_. When these poisons are absorbed into the
 31404	general circulation they give rise to certain groups of symptoms--such
 31405	as rise of temperature, associated circulatory and respiratory
 31406	derangements, interference with the gastro-intestinal functions and also
 31407	with those of the nervous system--which go to make up the condition
 31408	known as blood-poisoning, toxaemia, or _bacterial intoxication_. In
 31409	addition to this, certain bacteria produce toxins that give rise to
 31410	definite and distinct groups of symptoms--such as the convulsions of
 31411	tetanus, or the paralyses that follow diphtheria.
 31412	
 31413	_Death of Bacteria._--Under certain circumstances, it would appear that
 31414	the accumulation of the toxic products of bacterial action tends to
 31415	interfere with the continued life and growth of the organisms
 31416	themselves, and in this way the natural cure of certain diseases is
 31417	brought about. Outside the body, bacteria may be killed by starvation,
 31418	by want of moisture, by being subjected to high temperature, or by the
 31419	action of certain chemical agents of which carbolic acid, the
 31420	perchloride and biniodide of mercury, and various chlorine preparations
 31421	are the most powerful.
 31422	
 31423	#Immunity.#--Some persons are insusceptible to infection by certain
 31424	diseases, from which they are said to enjoy a _natural immunity_. In
 31425	many acute diseases one attack protects the patient, for a time at
 31426	least, from a second attack--_acquired immunity_.
 31427	
 31428	_Phagocytosis._--In the production of immunity the leucocytes and
 31429	certain other cells play an important part in virtue of the power they
 31430	possess of ingesting bacteria and of destroying them by a process of
 31431	intra-cellular digestion. To this process Metchnikoff gave the name of
 31432	_phagocytosis_, and he recognised two forms of _phagocytes_: (1) the
 31433	_microphages_, which are the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes of the blood;
 31434	and (2) the _macrophages_, which include the larger hyaline leucocytes,
 31435	endothelial cells, and connective-tissue corpuscles.
 31436	
 31437	During the process of phagocytosis, the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes in
 31438	the circulating blood increase greatly in numbers (_leucocytosis_), as
 31439	well as in their phagocytic action, and in the course of destroying the
 31440	bacteria they produce certain ferments which enter the blood serum.
 31441	These are known as _opsonins_ or _alexins_, and they act on the bacteria
 31442	by a process comparable to narcotisation, and render them an easy prey
 31443	for the phagocytes.
 31444	
 31445	_Artificial or Passive Immunity._--A form of immunity can be induced by
 31446	the introduction of protective substances obtained from an animal which
 31447	has been actively immunised. The process by which passive immunity is
 31448	acquired depends upon the fact that as a result of the reaction between
 31449	the specific virus of a particular disease (the _antigen_) and the
 31450	tissues of the animal attacked, certain substances--_antibodies_--are
 31451	produced, which when transferred to the body of a susceptible animal
 31452	protect it against that disease. The most important of these antibodies
 31453	are the _antitoxins_. From the study of the processes by which immunity
 31454	is secured against the effects of bacterial action the serum and vaccine
 31455	methods of treating certain infective diseases have been evolved. The
 31456	_serum treatment_ is designed to furnish the patient with a sufficiency
 31457	of antibodies to neutralise the infection. The anti-diphtheritic and the
 31458	anti-tetanic act by neutralising the specific toxins of the
 31459	disease--_antitoxic serums_; the anti-streptcoccic and the serum for
 31460	anthrax act upon the bacteria--_anti-bacterial serums_.
 31461	
 31462	A _polyvalent_ serum, that is, one derived from an animal which has been
 31463	immunised by numerous strains of the organism derived from various
 31464	sources, is much more efficacious than when a single strain has been
 31465	used.
 31466	
 31467	_Clinical Use of Serums._--Every precaution must be taken to prevent
 31468	organismal contamination of the serum or of the apparatus by means of
 31469	which it is injected. Syringes are so made that they can be sterilised
 31470	by boiling. The best situations for injection are under the skin of the
 31471	abdomen, the thorax, or the buttock, and the skin should be purified at
 31472	the seat of puncture. If the bulk of the full dose is large, it should
 31473	be divided and injected into different parts of the body, not more than
 31474	20 c.c. being injected at one place. The serum may be introduced
 31475	directly into a vein, or into the spinal canal, _e.g._ anti-tetanic
 31476	serum. The immunity produced by injections of antitoxic sera lasts only
 31477	for a comparatively short time, seldom longer than a few weeks.
 31478	
 31479	_"Serum Disease" and Anaphylaxis._--It is to be borne in mind that some
 31480	patients exhibit a supersensitiveness with regard to protective sera, an
 31481	injection being followed in a few days by the appearance of an
 31482	urticarial or erythematous rash, pain and swelling of the joints, and a
 31483	variable degree of fever. These symptoms, to which the name _serum
 31484	disease_ is applied, usually disappear in the course of a few days.
 31485	
 31486	The term _anaphylaxis_ is applied to an allied condition of
 31487	supersensitiveness which appears to be induced by the injection of
 31488	certain substances, including toxins and sera, that are capable of
 31489	acting as antigens. When a second injection is given after an interval
 31490	of some days, if anaphylaxis has been established by the first dose, the
 31491	patient suddenly manifests toxic symptoms of the nature of profound
 31492	shock which may even prove fatal. The conditions which render a person
 31493	liable to develop anaphylaxis and the mechanism by which it is
 31494	established are as yet imperfectly understood.
 31495	
 31496	_Vaccine Treatment._--The vaccine treatment elaborated by A. E. Wright
 31497	consists in injecting, while the disease is still active, specially
 31498	prepared dead cultures of the causative organisms, and is based on the
 31499	fact that these "vaccines" render the bacteria in the tissues less able
 31500	to resist the attacks of the phagocytes. The method is most successful
 31501	when the vaccine is prepared from organisms isolated from the patient
 31502	himself, _autogenous vaccine_, but when this is impracticable, or takes
 31503	a considerable time, laboratory-prepared polyvalent _stock vaccines_ may
 31504	be used.
 31505	
 31506	_Clinical Use of Vaccines._--Vaccines should not be given while a
 31507	patient is in a negative phase, as a certain amount of the opsonin in
 31508	the blood is used up in neutralising the substances injected, and this
 31509	may reduce the opsonic index to such an extent that the vaccines
 31510	themselves become dangerous. As a rule, the propriety of using a vaccine
 31511	can be determined from the general condition of the patient. The initial
 31512	dose should always be a small one, particularly if the disease is acute,
 31513	and the subsequent dosage will be regulated by the effect produced. If
 31514	marked constitutional disturbance with rise of temperature follows the
 31515	use of a vaccine, it indicates a negative phase, and calls for a
 31516	diminution in the next dose. If, on the other hand, the local as well as
 31517	the general condition of the patient improves after the injection, it
 31518	indicates a positive phase, and the original dose may be repeated or
 31519	even increased. Vaccines are best introduced subcutaneously, a part
 31520	being selected which is not liable to pressure, as there is sometimes
 31521	considerable local reaction. Repeated doses may be necessary at
 31522	intervals of a few days.
 31523	
 31524	The vaccine treatment has been successfully employed in various
 31525	tuberculous lesions, in pyogenic infections such as acne, boils,
 31526	sycosis, streptococcal, pneumococcal, and gonococcal conditions, in
 31527	infections of the accessory air sinuses, and in other diseases caused by
 31528	bacteria.
 31529	
 31530	
 31531	PYOGENIC BACTERIA
 31532	
 31533	From the point of view of the surgeon the most important varieties of
 31534	micro-organisms are those that cause inflammation and suppuration--the
 31535	_pyogenic bacteria_. This group includes a great many species, and these
 31536	are so widely distributed that they are to be met with under all
 31537	conditions of everyday life.
 31538	
 31539	The nature of the inflammatory and suppurative processes will be
 31540	considered in detail later; suffice it here to say that they are brought
 31541	about by the action of one or other of the organisms that we have now to
 31542	consider.
 31543	
 31544	It is found that the _staphylococci_, which cluster into groups, tend to
 31545	produce localised lesions; while the chain-forms--_streptococci_--give
 31546	rise to diffuse, spreading conditions. Many varieties of pyogenic
 31547	bacteria have now been differentiated, the best known being the
 31548	staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus, and the bacillus coli
 31549	communis.
 31550	
 31551	[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Staphylococcus aureus in Pus from case of
 31552	Osteomyelitis. x 1000 diam. Gram's stain.]
 31553	
 31554	_Staphylococcus Aureus._--This is the commonest organism found in
 31555	localised inflammatory and suppurative conditions. It varies greatly in
 31556	its virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin
 31557	pustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone. As
 31558	seen by the microscope it occurs in grape-like clusters, fission of the
 31559	individual cells taking place irregularly (Fig. 2). When grown in
 31560	artificial media, the colonies assume an orange-yellow colour--hence the
 31561	name _aureus_. It is of high vitality and resists more prolonged
 31562	exposure to high temperatures than most non-sporing bacteria. It is
 31563	capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods, for example, in
 31564	the marrow of long bones, and of again becoming active and causing a
 31565	fresh outbreak of suppuration. This organism is widely distributed: it
 31566	is found on the skin, in the mouth, and in other situations in the body,
 31567	and as it is present in the dust of the air and on all objects upon
 31568	which dust has settled, it is a continual source of infection unless
 31569	means are taken to exclude it from wounds.
 31570	
 31571	The _staphylococcus albus_ is much less common than the aureus, but has
 31572	the same properties and characters, save that its growth on artificial
 31573	media assumes a white colour. It is the common cause of stitch
 31574	abscesses, the skin being its normal habitat.
 31575	
 31576	[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Streptococci in Pus from an acute abscess in
 31577	subcutaneous tissue. x 1000 diam. Gram's stain.]
 31578	
 31579	_Streptococcus Pyogenes._--This organism also varies greatly in its
 31580	virulence; in some instances--for example in erysipelas--it causes a
 31581	sharp attack of acute spreading inflammation, which soon subsides
 31582	without showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other
 31583	conditions it gives rise to a generalised infection which rapidly proves
 31584	fatal. The streptococcus has less capacity of liquefying the tissues
 31585	than the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly.
 31586	At the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues
 31587	in their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes
 31588	which would otherwise exercise their protective influence. Streptococci
 31589	invade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading
 31590	conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and
 31591	suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and
 31592	inflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of
 31593	pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and
 31594	throat. Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading
 31595	gangrene and pyaemia.
 31596	
 31597	Division takes place in one axis, so that chains of varying length are
 31598	formed (Fig. 3). It is less easily cultivated by artificial media than
 31599	the staphylococcus; it forms a whitish growth.
 31600	
 31601	[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Bacillus coli communis in Urine, from a case of
 31602	Cystitis. x 1000 diam. Leishman's stain.]
 31603	
 31604	_Bacillus Coli Communis._--This organism, which is a normal inhabitant
 31605	of the intestinal tract, shows a great tendency to invade any organ or
 31606	tissue whose vitality is lowered. It is causatively associated with such
 31607	conditions as peritonitis and peritoneal suppuration resulting from
 31608	strangulated hernia, appendicitis, or perforation in any part of the
 31609	alimentary canal. In cystitis, pyelitis, abscess of the kidney,
 31610	suppuration in the bile-ducts or liver, and in many other abdominal
 31611	conditions, it plays a most important part. The discharge from wounds
 31612	infected by this organism has usually a foetid, or even a faecal odour,
 31613	and often contains gases resulting from putrefaction.
 31614	
 31615	It is a small rod-shaped organism with short flagellae, which render it
 31616	motile (Fig. 4). It closely resembles the typhoid bacillus, but is
 31617	distinguished from it by its behaviour in artificial culture media.
 31618	
 31619	[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Fraenkel's Pneumococci in Pus from Empyema
 31620	following Pneumonia. x 100 diam. Stained with Muir's capsule stain.]
 31621	
 31622	_Pneumo-bacteria._--Two forms of organism associated with
 31623	pneumonia--_Fraenkel's pneumococcus_ (one of the diplococci) (Fig. 5)
 31624	and _Friedlander's pneumo-bacillus_ (a short rod-shaped form)--are
 31625	frequently met with in inflammations of the serous and synovial
 31626	membranes, in suppuration in the liver, and in various other
 31627	inflammatory and suppurative conditions.
 31628	
 31629	_Bacillus Typhosus._--This organism has been found in pure culture in
 31630	suppurative conditions of bone, of cellular tissue, and of internal
 31631	organs, especially during convalescence from typhoid fever. Like the
 31632	staphylococcus, it is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long
 31633	periods.
 31634	
 31635	_Other Pyogenic Bacteria._--It is not necessary to do more than name
 31636	some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the
 31637	bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the
 31638	micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders
 31639	bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus. Most of these will receive further
 31640	mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.
 31641	
 31642	#Leucocytosis.#--Most bacterial diseases, as well as certain other
 31643	pathological conditions, are associated with an increase in the number
 31644	of leucocytes in the blood throughout the circulatory system. This
 31645	condition of the blood, which is known as _leucocytosis_, is believed to
 31646	be due to an excessive output and rapid formation of leucocytes by the
 31647	bone marrow, and it probably has as its object the arrest and
 31648	destruction of the invading organisms or toxins. To increase the
 31649	resisting power of the system to pathogenic organisms, an artificial
 31650	leucocytosis may be induced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of
 31651	nucleinate of soda (16 minims of a 5 per cent. solution).
 31652	
 31653	The _normal_ number of leucocytes per cubic millimetre varies in
 31654	different individuals, and in the same individual under different
 31655	conditions, from 5000 to 10,000: 7500 is a normal average, and anything
 31656	above 12,000 is considered abnormal. When leucocytosis is present, the
 31657	number may range from 12,000 to 30,000 or even higher; 40,000 is looked
 31658	upon as a high degree of leucocytosis. According to Ehrlich, the
 31659	following may be taken as the standard proportion of the various forms
 31660	of leucocytes in normal blood: polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes, 70 to
 31661	72 per cent.; lymphocytes, 22 to 25 per cent.; eosinophile cells, 2 to 4
 31662	per cent.; large mononuclear and transitional leucocytes, 2 to 4 per
 31663	cent.; mast-cells, 0.5 to 2 per cent.
 31664	
 31665	In estimating the clinical importance of a leucocytosis, it is not
 31666	sufficient merely to count the aggregate number of leucocytes present. A
 31667	differential count must be made to determine which variety of cells is
 31668	in excess. In the majority of surgical affections it is chiefly the
 31669	granular polymorpho-nuclear neutrophile leucocytes that are in excess
 31670	(_ordinary leucocytosis_). In some cases, and particularly in parasitic
 31671	diseases such as trichiniasis and hydatid disease, the eosinophile
 31672	leucocytes also show a proportionate increase (_eosinophilia_). The term
 31673	_lymphocytosis_ is applied when there is an increase in the number of
 31674	circulating lymphocytes, as occurs, for example, in lymphatic leucaemia,
 31675	and in certain cases of syphilis.
 31676	
 31677	Leucocytosis is met with in nearly all acute infective diseases, and in
 31678	acute pyogenic inflammatory affections, particularly in those attended
 31679	with suppuration. In exceptionally acute septic conditions the extreme
 31680	virulence of the toxins may prevent the leucocytes reacting, and
 31681	leucocytosis may be absent. The absence of leucocytosis in a disease in
 31682	which it is usually present is therefore to be looked upon as a grave
 31683	omen, particularly when the general symptoms are severe. In some cases
 31684	of malignant disease the number of leucocytes is increased to 15,000 or
 31685	20,000. A few hours after a severe haemorrhage also there is usually a
 31686	leucocytosis of from 15,000 to 30,000, which lasts for three or four
 31687	days (Lyon). In cases of haemorrhage the leucocytosis is increased by
 31688	infusion of fluids into the circulation. After all operations there is
 31689	at least a transient leucocytosis (_post-operative leucocytosis_)
 31690	(F. I. Dawson).
 31691	
 31692	The leucocytosis begins soon after the infection manifests itself--for
 31693	example, by shivering, rigor, or rise of temperature. The number of
 31694	leucocytes rises somewhat rapidly, increases while the condition is
 31695	progressing, and remains high during the febrile period, but there is no
 31696	constant correspondence between the number of leucocytes and the height
 31697	of the temperature. The arrest of the inflammation and its resolution
 31698	are accompanied by a fall in the number of leucocytes, while the
 31699	occurrence of suppuration is attended with a further increase in their
 31700	number.
 31701	
 31702	In interpreting the "blood count," it is to be kept in mind that a
 31703	_physiological leucocytosis_ occurs within three or four hours of taking
 31704	a meal, especially one rich in proteins, from 1500 to 2000 being added
 31705	to the normal number. In this _digestion leucocytosis_ the increase is
 31706	chiefly in the polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes. Immediately before
 31707	and after delivery, particularly in primiparae, there is usually a
 31708	moderate degree of leucocytosis. If the labour is normal and the
 31709	puerperium uncomplicated, the number of leucocytes regains the normal in
 31710	about a week. Lactation has no appreciable effect on the number of
 31711	leucocytes. In new-born infants the leucocyte count is abnormally high,
 31712	ranging from 15,000 to 20,000. In children under one year of age, the
 31713	normal average is from 10,000 to 20,000.
 31714	
 31715	_Absence of Leucocytosis--Leucopenia._--In certain infective diseases
 31716	the number of leucocytes in the circulating blood is abnormally
 31717	low--3000 or 4000--and this condition is known as _leucopenia_. It
 31718	occurs in typhoid fever, especially in the later stages of the disease,
 31719	in tuberculous lesions unaccompanied by suppuration, in malaria, and in
 31720	most cases of uncomplicated influenza. The occurrence of leucocytosis in
 31721	any of these conditions is to be looked upon as an indication that a
 31722	mixed infection has taken place, and that some suppurative process is
 31723	present.
 31724	
 31725	The absence of leucocytosis in some cases of virulent septic poisoning
 31726	has already been referred to.
 31727	
 31728	It will be evident that too much reliance must not be placed upon a
 31729	single observation, particularly in emergency cases. Whenever possible,
 31730	a series of observations should be made, the blood being examined about
 31731	four hours after meals, and about the same hour each day.
 31732	
 31733	The clinical significance of the blood count in individual diseases will
 31734	be further referred to.
 31735	
 31736	_The Iodine or Glycogen Reaction._--The leucocyte count may be
 31737	supplemented by staining films of the blood with a watery solution of
 31738	iodine and potassium iodide. In all advancing purulent conditions, in
 31739	septic poisonings, in pneumonia, and in cancerous growths associated
 31740	with ulceration, a certain number of the polynuclear leucocytes are
 31741	stained a brown or reddish-brown colour, due to the action of the iodine
 31742	on some substance in the cells of the nature of glycogen. This reaction
 31743	is absent in serous effusions, in unmixed tuberculous infections, in
 31744	uncomplicated typhoid fever, and in the early stages of cancerous
 31745	growths.

 31752	INFLAMMATION
 31753	
 31754	
 31755	Definition--Nature of inflammation from surgical point of
 31756	    view--Sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation--Clinical
 31757	    aspects of inflammation--General principles of treatment--Chronic
 31758	    inflammation.
 31759	
 31760	Inflammation may be defined as the series of vital changes that occurs
 31761	in the tissues in response to irritation. These changes represent the
 31762	reaction of the tissue elements to the irritant, and constitute the
 31763	attempt made by nature to arrest or to limit its injurious effects, and
 31764	to repair the damage done by it.
 31765	
 31766	The phenomena which characterise the inflammatory reaction can be
 31767	induced by any form of irritation--such, for example, as mechanical
 31768	injury, the application of heat or of chemical substances, or the action
 31769	of pathogenic bacteria and their toxins--and they are essentially
 31770	similar in kind whatever the irritant may be. The extent to which the
 31771	process may go, however, and its effects on the part implicated and on
 31772	the system as a whole, vary with different irritants and with the
 31773	intensity and duration of their action. A mechanical, a thermal, or a
 31774	chemical irritant, acting alone, induces a degree of reaction directly
 31775	proportionate to its physical properties, and so long as it does not
 31776	completely destroy the vitality of the part involved, the changes in the
 31777	tissues are chiefly directed towards repairing the damage done to the
 31778	part, and the inflammatory reaction is not only compatible with the
 31779	occurrence of ideal repair, but may be looked upon as an integral step
 31780	in the reparative process.
 31781	
 31782	The irritation caused by infection with bacteria, on the other hand, is
 31783	cumulative, as the organisms not only multiply in the tissues, but in
 31784	addition produce chemical poisons (toxins) which aggravate the
 31785	irritative effects. The resulting reaction is correspondingly
 31786	progressive, and has as its primary object the expulsion of the irritant
 31787	and the limitation of its action. If the natural protective effort is
 31788	successful, the resulting tissue changes subserve the process of repair,
 31789	but if the bacteria gain the upper hand in the struggle, the
 31790	inflammatory reaction becomes more intense, certain of the tissue
 31791	elements succumb, and the process for the time being is a destructive
 31792	one. During the stage of bacterial inflammation, reparative processes
 31793	are in abeyance, and it is only after the inflammation has been allayed,
 31794	either by natural means or by the aid of the surgeon, that repair takes
 31795	place.
 31796	
 31797	In applying the antiseptic principle to the treatment of wounds, our
 31798	main object is to exclude or to eliminate the bacterial factor, and so
 31799	to prevent the inflammatory reaction going beyond the stage in which it
 31800	is protective, and just in proportion as we succeed in attaining this
 31801	object, do we favour the occurrence of ideal repair.
 31802	
 31803	#Sequence of Changes in Bacterial Inflammation.#--As the form of
 31804	inflammation with which we are most concerned is that due to the action
 31805	of bacteria, in describing the process by which the protective influence
 31806	of the inflammatory reaction is brought into play, we shall assume the
 31807	presence of a bacterial irritant.
 31808	
 31809	The introduction of a colony of micro-organisms is quickly followed by
 31810	an accumulation of wandering cells, and proliferation of
 31811	connective-tissue cells in the tissues at the site of infection. The
 31812	various cells are attracted to the bacteria by a peculiar chemical or
 31813	biological power known as _chemotaxis_, which seems to result from
 31814	variations in the surface tension of different varieties of cells,
 31815	probably caused by some substance produced by the micro-organisms.
 31816	Changes in the blood vessels then ensue, the arteries becoming dilated
 31817	and the rate of the current in them being for a time increased--_active
 31818	hyperaemia_. Soon, however, the rate of the blood flow becomes slower
 31819	than normal, and in course of time the current may cease (_stasis_), and
 31820	the blood in the vessels may even coagulate (_thrombosis_). Coincidently
 31821	with these changes in the vessels, the leucocytes in the blood of the
 31822	inflamed part rapidly increase in number, and they become viscous and
 31823	adhere to the vessel wall, where they may accumulate in large numbers.
 31824	In course of time the leucocytes pass through the vessel
 31825	wall--_emigration of leucocytes_--and move towards the seat of
 31826	infection, giving rise to a marked degree of _local leucocytosis_.
 31827	Through the openings by which the leucocytes have escaped from the
 31828	vessels, red corpuscles may be passively extruded--_diapedesis of red
 31829	corpuscles_. These processes are accompanied by changes in the
 31830	endothelium of the vessel walls, which result in an increased formation
 31831	of lymph, which transudes into the meshes of the connective tissue
 31832	giving rise to an _inflammatory oedema_, or, if the inflammation is on a
 31833	free surface, forming an _inflammatory exudate_. The quantity and
 31834	characters of this exudate vary in different parts of the body, and
 31835	according to the nature, virulence, and location of the organisms
 31836	causing the inflammation. Thus it may be _serous_, as in some forms of
 31837	synovitis; _sero-fibrinous_, as in certain varieties of peritonitis, the
 31838	fibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming
 31839	adhesions; _croupous_, when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a
 31840	false membrane, as in diphtheria; _haemorrhagic_ when mixed with blood;
 31841	or _purulent_, when suppuration has occurred. The protective effects of
 31842	the inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation
 31843	of lymph and the emigration of leucocytes. The lymph contains the
 31844	opsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist
 31845	the attack of the phagocytes, as well as the various protective
 31846	antibodies which neutralise the toxins. The polymorph leucocytes are the
 31847	principal agents in the process of phagocytosis (p. 22), and together
 31848	with the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria.
 31849	
 31850	If the attempt to repel the invading organisms is successful, the
 31851	irritant effects are overcome, the inflammation is arrested, and
 31852	_resolution_ is said to take place.
 31853	
 31854	Certain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore
 31855	the condition to the normal, and _repair_ ensues after the manner
 31856	already described. In certain situations, notably in tendon sheaths, in
 31857	the cavities of joints, and in the interior of serous cavities, for
 31858	example the pleura and peritoneum, the restoration to the normal is not
 31859	perfect, adhesions forming between the opposing surfaces.
 31860	
 31861	If, however, the reaction induced by the infection is insufficient to
 31862	check the growth and spread of the organisms, or to inhibit their toxin
 31863	production, local necrosis of tissue may take place, either in the form
 31864	of suppuration or of gangrene, or the toxins absorbed into the
 31865	circulation may produce blood-poisoning, which may even prove fatal.
 31866	
 31867	#Clinical Aspects of Inflammation.#--It must clearly be understood that
 31868	inflammation is not to be looked upon as a disease in itself, but rather
 31869	as an evidence of some infective process going on in the tissues in
 31870	which it occurs, and of an effort on the part of these tissues to
 31871	overcome the invading organisms and their products. The chief danger to
 31872	the patient lies, not in the reactive changes that constitute the
 31873	inflammatory process, but in the fact that he is liable to be poisoned
 31874	by the toxins of the bacteria at work in the inflamed area.
 31875	
 31876	Since the days of Celsus (first century A.D.), heat, redness, swelling,
 31877	and pain have been recognised as cardinal signs of inflammation, and to
 31878	these may be added, interference with function in the inflamed part, and
 31879	general constitutional disturbance. Variations in these signs and
 31880	symptoms depend upon the acuteness of the condition, the nature of the
 31881	causative organism and of the tissue attacked, the situation of the part
 31882	in relation to the surface, and other factors.
 31883	
 31884	The _heat_ of the inflamed part is to be attributed to the increased
 31885	quantity of blood present in it, and the more superficial the affected
 31886	area the more readily is the local increase of temperature detected by
 31887	the hand. This clinical point is best tested by placing the palm of the
 31888	hand and fingers for a few seconds alternately over an uninflamed and an
 31889	inflamed area, otherwise under similar conditions as to coverings and
 31890	exposure. In this way even slight differences may be recognised.
 31891	
 31892	_Redness_, similarly, is due to the increased afflux of blood to the
 31893	inflamed part. The shade of colour varies with the stage of the
 31894	inflammation, being lighter and brighter in the early, hyperaemic stages,
 31895	and darker and duskier when the blood flow is slowed or when stasis has
 31896	occurred and the oxygenation of the blood is defective. In the
 31897	thrombotic stage the part may assume a purplish hue.
 31898	
 31899	The _swelling_ is partly due to the increased amount of blood in the
 31900	affected part and to the accumulation of leucocytes and proliferated
 31901	tissue cells, but chiefly to the exudate in the connective
 31902	tissue--_inflammatory oedema_. The more open the structure of the tissue
 31903	of the part, the greater is the amount of swelling--witness the marked
 31904	degree of oedema that occurs in such parts as the scrotum or the eyelids.
 31905	
 31906	_Pain_ is a symptom seldom absent in inflammation. _Tenderness_--that
 31907	is, pain elicited on pressure--is one of the most valuable diagnostic
 31908	signs we possess, and is often present before pain is experienced by the
 31909	patient. That the area of tenderness corresponds to the area of
 31910	inflammation is almost an axiom of surgery. Pain and tenderness are due
 31911	to the irritation of nerve filaments of the part, rendered all the more
 31912	sensitive by the abnormal conditions of their blood supply. In
 31913	inflammatory conditions of internal organs, for example the abdominal
 31914	viscera, the pain is frequently referred to other parts, usually to an
 31915	area supplied by branches from the same segment of the cord as that
 31916	supplying the inflamed part.
 31917	
 31918	For purposes of diagnosis, attention should be paid to the terms in
 31919	which the patient describes his pain. For example, the pain caused by
 31920	an inflammation of the skin is usually described as of a _burning_ or
 31921	_itching_ character; that of inflammation in dense tissues like
 31922	periosteum or bone, or in encapsuled organs, as _dull_, _boring_, or
 31923	_aching_. When inflammation is passing on to suppuration the pain
 31924	assumes a _throbbing_ character, and as the pus reaches the surface, or
 31925	"points," as it is called, sharp, _darting_, or _lancinating_ pains are
 31926	experienced. Inflammation involving a nerve-trunk may cause a _boring_
 31927	or a _tingling_ pain; while the implication of a serous membrane such as
 31928	the pleura or peritoneum gives rise to a pain of a sharp, _stabbing_
 31929	character.
 31930	
 31931	_Interference with the function_ of the inflamed part is always present
 31932	to a greater or less extent.
 31933	
 31934	#Constitutional Disturbances.#--Under the term constitutional
 31935	disturbances are included the presence of fever or elevation of
 31936	temperature; certain changes in the pulse rate and the respiration;
 31937	gastro-intestinal and urinary disturbances; and derangements of the
 31938	central nervous system. These are all due to the absorption of toxins
 31939	into the general circulation.
 31940	
 31941	_Temperature._--A marked rise of temperature is one of the most constant
 31942	and important concomitants of acute inflammatory conditions, and the
 31943	temperature chart forms a fairly reliable index of the state of the
 31944	patient. The toxins interfere with the nerve-centres in the medulla that
 31945	regulate the balance between the production and the loss of body heat.
 31946	
 31947	Clinically the temperature is estimated by means of a self-registering
 31948	thermometer placed, for from one to five minutes, in close contact with
 31949	the skin in the axilla, or in the mouth. Sometimes the thermometer is
 31950	inserted into the rectum, where, however, the temperature is normally
 31951	3/4 o F. higher than in the axilla.
 31952	
 31953	_In health_ the temperature of the body is maintained at a mean of about
 31954	98.4 o F. (37 o C.) by the heat-regulating mechanism. It varies from hour
 31955	to hour even in health, reaching its maximum between four and eight in
 31956	the evening, when it may rise to 99 o F., and is at its lowest between
 31957	four and six in the morning, when it may be about 97 o F.
 31958	
 31959	The temperature is more easily disturbed in children than in adults, and
 31960	may become markedly elevated (104 o or 105 o F.) from comparatively slight
 31961	causes; in the aged it is less liable to change, so that a rise to 103 o
 31962	or 104 o F. is to be looked upon as indicating a high state of fever.
 31963	
 31964	A sudden rise of temperature is usually associated with a feeling of
 31965	chilliness down the back and in the limbs, which may be so marked that
 31966	the patient shivers violently, while the skin becomes cold, pale, and
 31967	shrivelled--_cutis anserina_. This is a nervous reaction due to a want
 31968	of correspondence between the internal and the surface temperature of
 31969	the body, and is known clinically as a _rigor_. When the temperature
 31970	rises gradually the chill is usually slight and may be unobserved. Even
 31971	during the cold stage, however, the internal temperature is already
 31972	raised, and by the time the chill has passed off its maximum has been
 31973	reached.
 31974	
 31975	The _pulse_ is always increased in frequency, and usually varies
 31976	directly with the height of the temperature. _Respiration_ is more
 31977	active during the progress of an inflammation; and bronchial catarrh is
 31978	common apart from any antecedent respiratory disease.
 31979	
 31980	_Gastro-intestinal disturbances_ take the form of loss of appetite,
 31981	vomiting, diminished secretion of the alimentary juices, and weakening
 31982	of the peristalsis of the bowel, leading to thirst, dry, furred tongue,
 31983	and constipation. Diarrhoea is sometimes present. The _urine_ is usually
 31984	scanty, of high specific gravity, rich in nitrogenous substances,
 31985	especially urea and uric acid, and in calcium salts, while sodium
 31986	chloride is deficient. Albumin and hyaline casts may be present in cases
 31987	of severe inflammation with high temperature. The significance of
 31988	general _leucocytosis_ has already been referred to.
 31989	
 31990	#General Principles of Treatment.#--The capacity of the inflammatory
 31991	reaction for dealing with bacterial infections being limited, it often
 31992	becomes necessary for the surgeon to aid the natural defensive
 31993	processes, as well as to counteract the local and general effects of the
 31994	reaction, and to relieve symptoms.
 31995	
 31996	The ideal means of helping the tissues is by removing the focus of
 31997	infection, and when this can be done, as for example in a carbuncle or
 31998	an anthrax pustule, the infected area may be completely excised. When
 31999	the focus is not sufficiently limited to admit of this, the infected
 32000	tissue may be scraped away with the sharp spoon, or destroyed by
 32001	caustics or by the actual cautery. If this is inadvisable, the organisms
 32002	may be attacked by strong antiseptics, such as pure carbolic acid.
 32003	
 32004	Moist dressings favour the removal of bacteria by promoting the escape
 32005	of the inflammatory exudate, in which they are washed out.
 32006	
 32007	#Artificial Hyperaemia.#--When such direct means as the above are
 32008	impracticable, much can be done to aid the tissues in their struggle by
 32009	improving the condition of the circulation in the inflamed area, so as
 32010	to ensure that a plentiful supply of fresh arterial blood reaches it.
 32011	The beneficial effects of _hot fomentations and poultices_ depend on
 32012	their causing a dilatation of the vessels, and so inducing a hyperaemia
 32013	in the affected area. It has been shown experimentally that repeated,
 32014	short applications of moist heat (not exceeding 106 o F.) are more
 32015	efficacious than continuous application. It is now believed that the
 32016	so-called _counter-irritants_--mustard, iodine, cantharides, actual
 32017	cautery--act in the same way; and the method of treating erysipelas by
 32018	applying a strong solution of iodine around the affected area is based
 32019	on the same principle.
 32020	
 32021	[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Passive Hyperaemia of Hand and Forearm induced by
 32022	Bier's Bandage.]
 32023	
 32024	While these and similar methods have long been employed in the treatment
 32025	of inflammatory conditions, it is only within comparatively recent years
 32026	that their mode of action has been properly understood, and to August
 32027	Bier belongs the credit of having put the treatment of inflammation on a
 32028	scientific and rational basis. Recognising the "beneficent intention" of
 32029	the inflammatory reaction, and the protective action of the leucocytosis
 32030	which accompanies the hyperaemic stages of the process, Bier was led to
 32031	study the effects of increasing the hyperaemia by artificial means. As a
 32032	result of his observations, he has formulated a method of treatment
 32033	which consists in inducing an artificial hyperaemia in the inflamed area,
 32034	either by obstructing the venous return from the part (_passive
 32035	hyperaemia_), or by stimulating the arterial flow through it (_active
 32036	hyperaemia_).
 32037	
 32038	_Bier's Constricting Bandage._--To induce a _passive hyperaemia_ in a
 32039	limb, an elastic bandage is applied some distance above the inflamed
 32040	area sufficiently tightly to obstruct the venous return from the distal
 32041	parts without arresting in any way the inflow of arterial blood (Fig. 6).
 32042	If the constricting band is correctly applied, the parts beyond
 32043	become swollen and oedematous, and assume a bluish-red hue, but they
 32044	retain their normal temperature, the pulse is unchanged, and there is no
 32045	pain. If the part becomes blue, cold, or painful, or if any existing
 32046	pain is increased, the band has been applied too tightly. The hyperaemia
 32047	is kept up from twenty to twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four, and
 32048	in the intervals the limb is elevated to get rid of the oedema and to
 32049	empty it of impure blood, and so make room for a fresh supply of healthy
 32050	blood when the bandage is re-applied. As the inflammation subsides, the
 32051	period during which the band is kept on each day is diminished; but the
 32052	treatment should be continued for some days after all signs of
 32053	inflammation have subsided.
 32054	
 32055	This method of treating acute inflammatory conditions necessitates
 32056	close supervision until the correct degree of tightness of the band has
 32057	been determined.
 32058	
 32059	[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Passive Hyperaemia of Finger induced by Klapp's
 32060	Suction Bell.]
 32061	
 32062	_Klapp's Suction Bells._--In inflammatory conditions to which the
 32063	constricting band cannot be applied, as for example an acute mastitis, a
 32064	bubo in the groin, or a boil on the neck, the affected area may be
 32065	rendered hyperaemic by an appropriately shaped glass bell applied over it
 32066	and exhausted by means of a suction-pump, the rarefaction of the air in
 32067	the bell determining a flow of blood into the tissues enclosed within it
 32068	(Figs. 7 and 8). The edge of the bell is smeared with vaseline, and the
 32069	suction applied for from five to ten minutes at a time, with a
 32070	corresponding interval between the applications. Each sitting lasts for
 32071	from half an hour to an hour, and the treatment may be carried out once
 32072	or twice a day according to circumstances. This apparatus acts in the
 32073	same way as the old-fashioned _dry cup_, and is more convenient and
 32074	equally efficacious.
 32075	
 32076	[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Passive Hyperaemia induced by Klapp's Suction
 32077	Bell for Inflammation of Inguinal Gland.]
 32078	
 32079	_Active hyperaemia_ is induced by the local application of heat,
 32080	particularly by means of hot air. It has not proved so useful in acute
 32081	inflammation as passive hyperaemia, but is of great value in hastening
 32082	the absorption of inflammatory products and in overcoming adhesions and
 32083	stiffness in tendons and joints.
 32084	
 32085	_General Treatment._--The patient should be kept at rest, preferably in
 32086	bed, to diminish the general tissue waste; and the diet should be
 32087	restricted to fluids, such as milk, beef-tea, meat juices or gruel, and
 32088	these may be rendered more easily assimilable by artificial digestion if
 32089	necessary. To counteract the general effect of toxins absorbed into
 32090	the circulation, specific antitoxic sera are employed in certain forms
 32091	of infection, such as diphtheria, streptococcal septicaemia, and tetanus.
 32092	In other forms of infection, vaccines are employed to increase the
 32093	opsonic power of the blood. When such means are not available, the
 32094	circulating toxins may to some extent be diluted by giving plenty of
 32095	bland fluids by the mouth or normal salt solution by the rectum.
 32096	
 32097	The elimination of the toxins is promoted by securing free action of the
 32098	emunctories. A saline purge, such as half an ounce of sulphate of
 32099	magnesium in a small quantity of water, ensures a free evacuation of the
 32100	bowels. The kidneys are flushed by such diluent drinks as equal parts of
 32101	milk and lime water, or milk with a dram of liquor calcis saccharatus
 32102	added to each tumblerful. Barley-water and "Imperial drink," which
 32103	consists of a dram and a half of cream of tartar added to a pint of
 32104	boiling water and sweetened with sugar after cooling, are also useful
 32105	and non-irritating diuretics. The skin may be stimulated by Dover's
 32106	powder (10 grains) or liquor ammoniae acetatis in three-dram doses every
 32107	four hours.
 32108	
 32109	Various drugs administered internally, such as quinine, salol,
 32110	salicylate of iron, and others, have a reputation, more or less
 32111	deserved, as internal antiseptics.
 32112	
 32113	Weakness of the heart, as indicated by the condition of the pulse, is
 32114	treated by the use of such drugs as digitalis, strophanthus, or
 32115	strychnin, according to circumstances.
 32116	
 32117	Gastro-intestinal disturbances are met by ordinary medical means.
 32118	Vomiting, for example, can sometimes be checked by effervescing drinks,
 32119	such as citrate of caffein, or by dilute hydrocyanic acid and bismuth.
 32120	In severe cases, and especially when the vomited matter resembles
 32121	coffee-grounds from admixture with altered blood--the so-called
 32122	post-operative haematemesis--the best means of arresting the vomiting is
 32123	by washing out the stomach. Thirst is relieved by rectal injections of
 32124	saline solution. The introduction of saline solution into the veins or
 32125	by the rectum is also useful in diluting and hastening the elimination
 32126	of circulating toxins.
 32127	
 32128	In surgical inflammations, as a rule, nothing is gained by lowering the
 32129	temperature, unless at the same time the cause is removed. When severe
 32130	or prolonged pyrexia becomes a source of danger, the use of hot or cold
 32131	sponging, or even the cold bath, is preferable to the administration of
 32132	drugs.
 32133	
 32134	_Relief of Symptoms._--For the relief of _pain_, rest is essential. The
 32135	inflamed part should be placed in a splint or other appliance which will
 32136	prevent movement, and steps must be taken to reduce its functional
 32137	activity as far as possible. Locally, warm and moist dressings, such as
 32138	a poultice or fomentation, may be used. To make a fomentation, a piece
 32139	of flannel or lint is wrung out of very hot water or antiseptic lotion
 32140	and applied under a sheet of mackintosh. Fomentations should be renewed
 32141	as often as they cool. An ordinary india-rubber bag filled with hot
 32142	water and fixed over the fomentation, by retaining the heat, obviates
 32143	the necessity of frequently changing the application. The addition of a
 32144	few drops of laudanum sprinkled on the flannel has a soothing effect.
 32145	Lead and opium lotion is a useful, soothing application employed as a
 32146	fomentation. We prefer the application of lint soaked in a 10 per cent.
 32147	aqueous or glycerine solution of ichthyol, or smeared with ichthyol
 32148	ointment (1 in 3). Belladonna and glycerine, equal parts, may be used.
 32149	
 32150	Dry cold obtained by means of icebags, or by Leiter's lead tubes through
 32151	which a continuous stream of ice-cold water is kept flowing, is
 32152	sometimes soothing to the patient, but when the vessels in the inflamed
 32153	part are greatly congested its use is attended with considerable risk,
 32154	as it not only contracts the arterioles supplying the part, but also
 32155	diminishes the outflow of venous blood, and so may determine gangrene of
 32156	tissues already devitalised.
 32157	
 32158	A milder form of employing cold is by means of evaporating lotions: a
 32159	thin piece of lint or gauze is applied over the inflamed part and kept
 32160	constantly moist with the lotion, the dressing being left freely exposed
 32161	to allow of continuous evaporation. A useful evaporating lotion is made
 32162	up as follows: take of chloride of ammonium, half an ounce; rectified
 32163	spirit, one ounce; and water, seven ounces.
 32164	
 32165	The administration of opiates may be necessary for the relief of pain.
 32166	
 32167	The accumulation of an excessive amount of inflammatory exudate may
 32168	endanger the vitality of the tissues by pressing on the blood vessels to
 32169	such an extent as to cause stasis, and by concentrating the local action
 32170	of the toxins. Under such conditions the tension should be relieved and
 32171	the exudate with its contained toxins removed by making an incision into
 32172	the inflamed tissues, and applying a suction bell. When the exudate has
 32173	collected in a synovial cavity, such as a joint or bursa, it may be
 32174	withdrawn by means of a trocar and cannula. There are other methods of
 32175	withdrawing blood and exudate from an inflamed area, for example by
 32176	leeches or wet-cupping, but they are seldom employed now.
 32177	
 32178	Before applying leeches the part must be thoroughly cleansed, and if
 32179	the leech is slow to bite, may be smeared with cream. The leech is
 32180	retained in position under an inverted wine-glass or wide test-tube till
 32181	it takes hold. After it has sucked its fill it usually drops off, having
 32182	withdrawn a dram or a dram and a half of blood. If it be desirable to
 32183	withdraw more blood, hot fomentations should be applied to the bite. As
 32184	it is sometimes necessary to employ considerable pressure to stop the
 32185	bleeding, leeches should, if possible, be applied over a bone which will
 32186	furnish the necessary resistance. The use of styptics may be called for.
 32187	
 32188	_Wet-cupping_ has almost entirely been superseded by the use of Klapp's
 32189	suction bells.
 32190	
 32191	_General blood-letting_ consists in opening a superficial vein
 32192	(venesection) and allowing from eight to ten ounces of blood to flow
 32193	from it. It is seldom used in the treatment of surgical forms of
 32194	inflammation.
 32195	
 32196	_Counter-irritants._--In deep-seated inflammations, counter-irritants
 32197	are sometimes employed in the form of mustard leaves or blisters,
 32198	according to the degree of irritation required. A mustard leaf or
 32199	plaster should not be left on longer than ten or fifteen minutes, unless
 32200	it is desired to produce a blister. Blistering may be produced by a
 32201	_cantharides plaster_, or by painting with _liquor epispasticus_. The
 32202	plaster should be left on from eight to ten hours, and if it has failed
 32203	to raise a blister, a hot fomentation should be applied to the part.
 32204	_Liquor epispasticus_, alone or mixed with equal parts of collodion, is
 32205	painted on the part with a brush. Several paintings are often required
 32206	before a blister is raised. The preliminary removal of the natural
 32207	grease from the skin favours the action of these applications.
 32208	
 32209	The treatment of inflammation in special tissues and organs will be
 32210	considered in the sections devoted to regional surgery.
 32211	
 32212	#Chronic Inflammation.#--A variety of types of chronic and subacute
 32213	inflammation are met with which, owing to ignorance of their causations,
 32214	cannot at present be satisfactorily classified.
 32215	
 32216	The best defined group is that of the _granulomata_, which includes such
 32217	important diseases as tuberculosis and syphilis, and in which different
 32218	types of chronic inflammation are caused by infection with a specific
 32219	organism, all having the common character, however, that abundant
 32220	granulation tissue is formed in which cellular changes are more in
 32221	evidence than changes in the blood vessels, and in which the subsequent
 32222	degeneration and necrosis of the granulation tissue results in the
 32223	breaking down and destruction of the tissue in which it is formed.
 32224	Another group is that in which chronic inflammation is due to mild or
 32225	attenuated forms of pyogenic infection affecting especially the lymph
 32226	glands and the bone marrow. In the glands of the groin, for example,
 32227	associated with various forms of irritation about the external genitals,
 32228	different types of _chronic lymphadenitis_ are met with; they do not
 32229	frankly suppurate as do the acute types, but are attended with a
 32230	hyperplasia of the tissue elements which results in enlargement of the
 32231	affected glands of a persistent, and sometimes of a relapsing character.
 32232	Similar varieties of _osteomyelitis_ are met with that do not, like the
 32233	acute forms, go on to suppuration or to death of bone, but result in
 32234	thickening of the bone affected, both on the surface and in the
 32235	interior, resulting in obliteration of the medullary canal.
 32236	
 32237	A third group of chronic inflammations are those that begin as an acute
 32238	pyogenic inflammation, which, instead of resolving completely, persists
 32239	in a chronic form. It does so apparently because there is some factor
 32240	aiding the organisms and handicapping the tissues, such as the presence
 32241	of a foreign body, a piece of glass or metal, or a piece of dead bone;
 32242	in these circumstances the inflammation persists in a chronic form,
 32243	attended with the formation of fibrous tissue, and, in the case of bone,
 32244	with the formation of new bone in excess. It will be evident that in
 32245	this group, chronic inflammation and repair are practically
 32246	interchangeable terms.
 32247	
 32248	There are other groups of chronic inflammation, the origin of which
 32249	continues to be the subject of controversy. Reference is here made to
 32250	the chronic inflammations of the synovial membrane of joints, of tendon
 32251	sheaths and of bursae--_chronic synovitis_, _teno-synovitis_ and
 32252	_bursitis_; of the fibrous tissues of joints--chronic forms of
 32253	_arthritis_; of the blood vessels--chronic forms of _endarteritis_ and
 32254	of _phlebitis_ and of the peripheral nerves--_neuritis_. Also in the
 32255	breast and in the prostate, with the waning of sexual life there may
 32256	occur a formation of fibrous tissue--chronic _interstitial mastitis_,
 32257	_chronic prostatitis_, having analogies with the chronic interstitial
 32258	inflammations of internal organs like the kidney--_chronic interstitial
 32259	nephritis_; and in the breast and prostate, as in the kidney, the
 32260	formation of fibrous tissue leads to changes in the secreting epithelium
 32261	resulting in the formation of cysts.
 32262	
 32263	Lastly, there are still other types of chronic inflammation attended
 32264	with the formation of fibrous tissue on such a liberal scale as to
 32265	suggest analogies with new growths. The best known of these are the
 32266	systematic forms of fibromatosis met with in the central nervous system
 32267	and in the peripheral nerves--_neuro-fibromatosis_; in the submucous
 32268	coat of the stomach--_gastric fibromatosis_; and in the
 32269	colon--_intestinal fibromatosis_.
 32270	
 32271	These conditions will be described with the tissues and organs in which
 32272	they occur.
 32273	
 32274	In the _treatment of chronic inflammations_, pending further knowledge
 32275	as to their causation, and beyond such obvious indications as to help
 32276	the tissues by removing a foreign body or a piece of dead bone, there
 32277	are employed--empirically--a number of procedures such as the induction
 32278	of hyperaemia, exposure to the X-rays, and the employment of blisters,
 32279	cauteries, and setons. Vaccines may be had recourse to in those of
 32280	bacterial origin.

 32295	    pyogenic infection--_Sapraemia_--_Septicaemia_--_Pyaemia_.
 32296	
 32297	Suppuration, or the formation of pus, is one of the results of the
 32298	action of bacteria on the tissues. The invading organism is usually one
 32299	of the staphylococci, less frequently a streptococcus, and still less
 32300	frequently one of the other bacteria capable of producing pus, such as
 32301	the bacillus coli communis, the gonococcus, the pneumococcus, or the
 32302	typhoid bacillus.
 32303	
 32304	So long as the tissues are in a healthy condition they are able to
 32305	withstand the attacks of moderate numbers of pyogenic bacteria of
 32306	ordinary virulence, but when devitalised by disease, by injury, or by
 32307	inflammation due to the action of other pathogenic organisms,
 32308	suppuration ensues.
 32309	
 32310	It would appear, for example, that pyogenic organisms can pass through
 32311	the healthy urinary tract without doing any damage, but if the pelvis of
 32312	the kidney, the ureter, or the bladder is the seat of stone, they give
 32313	rise to suppuration. Similarly, a calculus in one of the salivary ducts
 32314	frequently results in an abscess forming in the floor of the mouth. When
 32315	the lumen of a tubular organ, such as the appendix or the Fallopian tube
 32316	is blocked also, the action of pyogenic organisms is favoured and
 32317	suppuration ensues.
 32318	
 32319	#Pus.#--The fluid resulting from the process of suppuration is known
 32320	as _pus_. In its typical form it is a yellowish creamy substance, of
 32321	alkaline reaction, with a specific gravity of about 1030, and it has a
 32322	peculiar mawkish odour. If allowed to stand in a test-tube it does not
 32323	coagulate, but separates into two layers: the upper, transparent,
 32324	straw-coloured fluid, the _liquor puris_ or pus serum, closely
 32325	resembling blood serum in its composition, but containing less protein
 32326	and more cholestrol; it also contains leucin, tyrosin, and certain
 32327	albumoses which prevent coagulation.
 32328	
 32329	The layer at the bottom of the tube consists for the most part of
 32330	polymorph leucocytes, and proliferated connective tissue and endothelial
 32331	cells (_pus corpuscles_). Other forms of leucocytes may be present,
 32332	especially in long-standing suppurations; and there are usually some red
 32333	corpuscles, dead bacteria, fat cells and shreds of tissue, cholestrol
 32334	crystals, and other detritus in the deposit.
 32335	
 32336	If a film of fresh pus is examined under the microscope, the pus cells
 32337	are seen to have a well-defined rounded outline, and to contain a finely
 32338	granular protoplasm and a multi-partite nucleus; if still warm, the
 32339	cells may exhibit amoeboid movement. In stained films the nuclei take the
 32340	stain well. In older pus cells the outline is irregular, the protoplasm
 32341	coarsely granular, and the nuclei disintegrated, no longer taking the
 32342	stain.
 32343	
 32344	_Variations from Typical Pus._--Pus from old-standing sinuses is often
 32345	watery in consistence (ichorous), with few cells. Where the granulations
 32346	are vascular and bleed easily, it becomes sanious from admixture with
 32347	red corpuscles; while, if a blood-clot be broken down and the debris
 32348	mixed with the pus, it contains granules of blood pigment and is said to
 32349	be "grumous." The _odour_ of pus varies with the different bacteria
 32350	producing it. Pus due to ordinary pyogenic cocci has a mawkish odour;
 32351	when putrefactive organisms are present it has a putrid odour; when it
 32352	forms in the vicinity of the intestinal canal it usually contains the
 32353	bacillus coli communis and has a faecal odour.
 32354	
 32355	The _colour_ of pus also varies: when due to one or other of the
 32356	varieties of the bacillus pyocyaneus, it is usually of a blue or green
 32357	colour; when mixed with bile derivatives or altered blood pigment, it
 32358	may be of a bright orange colour. In wounds inflicted with rough iron
 32359	implements from which rust is deposited, the pus often presents the same
 32360	colour.
 32361	
 32362	The pus may form and collect within a circumscribed area, constituting a
 32363	localised _abscess_; or it may infiltrate the tissues over a wide
 32364	area--_diffuse suppuration_.
 32365	
 32366	
 32367	ACUTE CIRCUMSCRIBED ABSCESS
 32368	
 32369	Any tissue of the body may be the seat of an acute abscess, and there
 32370	are many routes by which the bacteria may gain access to the affected
 32371	area. For example: an abscess in the integument or subcutaneous
 32372	cellular tissue usually results from infection by organisms which have
 32373	entered through a wound or abrasion of the surface, or along the ducts
 32374	of the skin; an abscess in the breast from organisms which have passed
 32375	along the milk ducts opening on the nipple, or along the lymphatics
 32376	which accompany these. An abscess in a lymph gland is usually due to
 32377	infection passing by way of the lymph channels from the area of skin or
 32378	mucous membrane drained by them. Abscesses in internal organs, such as
 32379	the kidney, liver, or brain, usually result from organisms carried in
 32380	the blood-stream from some focus of infection elsewhere in the body.
 32381	
 32382	A knowledge of the possible avenues of infection is of clinical
 32383	importance, as it may enable the source of a given abscess to be traced
 32384	and dealt with. In suppuration in the Fallopian tube (pyosalpynx), for
 32385	example, the fact that the most common origin of the infection is in the
 32386	genital passage, leads to examination for vaginal discharge; and if none
 32387	is present, the abscess is probably due to infection carried in the
 32388	blood-stream from some primary focus about the mouth, such as a gumboil
 32389	or an infective sore throat.
 32390	
 32391	The exact location of an abscess also may furnish a key to its source;
 32392	in axillary abscess, for example, if the suppuration is in the lymph
 32393	glands the infection has come through the afferent lymphatics; if in the
 32394	cellular tissue, it has spread from the neck or chest wall; if in the
 32395	hair follicles, it is a local infection through the skin.
 32396	
 32397	#Formation of an Abscess.#--When pyogenic bacteria are introduced into
 32398	the tissue there ensues an inflammatory reaction, which is characterised
 32399	by dilatation of the blood vessels, exudation of large numbers of
 32400	leucocytes, and proliferation of connective-tissue cells. These
 32401	wandering cells soon accumulate round the focus of infection, and form a
 32402	protective barrier which tends to prevent the spread of the organisms
 32403	and to restrict their field of action. Within the area thus
 32404	circumscribed the struggle between the bacteria and the phagocytes takes
 32405	place, and in the process toxins are formed by the organisms, a certain
 32406	number of the leucocytes succumb, and, becoming degenerated, set free
 32407	certain proteolytic enzymes or ferments. The toxins cause
 32408	coagulation-necrosis of the tissue cells with which they come in
 32409	contact, the ferments liquefy the exudate and other albuminous
 32410	substances, and in this way _pus_ is formed.
 32411	
 32412	If the bacteria gain the upper hand, this process of liquefaction which
 32413	is characteristic of suppuration, extends into the surrounding tissues,
 32414	the protective barrier of leucocytes is broken down, and the
 32415	suppurative process spreads. A fresh accession of leucocytes, however,
 32416	forms a new barrier, and eventually the spread is arrested, and the
 32417	collection of pus so hemmed in constitutes an _abscess_.
 32418	
 32419	Owing to the swelling and condensation of the parts around, the pus thus
 32420	formed is under considerable pressure, and this causes it to burrow
 32421	along the lines of least resistance. In the case of a subcutaneous
 32422	abscess the pus usually works its way towards the surface, and "points,"
 32423	as it is called. Where it approaches the surface the skin becomes soft
 32424	and thin, and eventually sloughs, allowing the pus to escape.
 32425	
 32426	An abscess forming in the deeper planes is prevented from pointing
 32427	directly to the surface by the firm fasciae and other fibrous structures.
 32428	The pus therefore tends to burrow along the line of the blood vessels
 32429	and in the connective-tissue septa, till it either finds a weak spot or
 32430	causes a portion of fascia to undergo necrosis and so reaches the
 32431	surface. Accordingly, many abscess cavities resulting from deep-seated
 32432	suppuration are of irregular shape, with pouches and loculi in various
 32433	directions--an arrangement which interferes with their successful
 32434	treatment by incision and drainage.
 32435	
 32436	The relief of tension which follows the bursting of an abscess, the
 32437	removal of irritation by the escape of pus, and the casting off of
 32438	bacteria and toxins, allow the tissues once more to assert themselves,
 32439	and a process of repair sets in. The walls of the abscess fall in;
 32440	granulation tissue grows into the space and gradually fills it; and
 32441	later this is replaced by cicatricial tissue. As a result of the
 32442	subsequent contraction of the cicatricial tissue, the scar is usually
 32443	depressed below the level of the surrounding skin surface.
 32444	
 32445	If an abscess is prevented from healing--for example, by the presence of
 32446	a foreign body or a piece of necrosed bone--a sinus results, and from it
 32447	pus escapes until the foreign body is removed.
 32448	
 32449	#Clinical Features of an Acute Circumscribed Abscess.#--In the initial
 32450	stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present. Increased
 32451	elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive
 32452	leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and
 32453	suppuration. An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative
 32454	process is spreading.
 32455	
 32456	The local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess. When it is
 32457	situated superficially--for example, in the breast tissue--the affected
 32458	area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple
 32459	colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the
 32460	surface. The swelling increases in size, the firm brawny centre becomes
 32461	soft, projects as a cone beyond the level of the rest of the swollen
 32462	area, and is usually surrounded by a zone of induration.
 32463	
 32464	By gently palpating with the finger-tips over the softened area, a fluid
 32465	wave may be detected--_fluctuation_--and when present this is a certain
 32466	indication of the existence of fluid in the swelling. Its recognition,
 32467	however, is by no means easy, and various fallacies are to be guarded
 32468	against in applying this test clinically. When, for example, the walls
 32469	of the abscess are thick and rigid, or when its contents are under
 32470	excessive tension, the fluid wave cannot be elicited. On the other hand,
 32471	a sensation closely resembling fluctuation may often be recognised in
 32472	oedematous tissues, in certain soft, solid tumours such as fatty tumours
 32473	or vascular sarcomata, in aneurysm, and in a muscle when it is palpated
 32474	in its transverse axis.
 32475	
 32476	When pus has formed in deeper parts, and before it has reached the
 32477	surface, oedema of the overlying skin is frequently present, and the skin
 32478	pits on pressure.
 32479	
 32480	With the formation of pus the continuous burning or boring pain of
 32481	inflammation assumes a throbbing character, with occasional sharp,
 32482	lancinating twinges. Should doubt remain as to the presence of pus,
 32483	recourse may be had to the use of an exploring needle.
 32484	
 32485	_Differential Diagnosis of Acute Abscess._--A practical difficulty which
 32486	frequently arises is to decide whether or not pus has actually formed.
 32487	It may be accepted as a working rule in practice that when an acute
 32488	inflammation has lasted for four or five days without showing signs of
 32489	abatement, suppuration has almost certainly occurred. In deep-seated
 32490	suppuration, marked oedema of the skin and the occurrence of rigors and
 32491	sweating may be taken to indicate the formation of pus.
 32492	
 32493	There are cases on record where rapidly growing sarcomatous and
 32494	angiomatous tumours, aneurysms, and the bruises that occur in
 32495	haemophylics, have been mistaken for acute abscesses and incised, with
 32496	disastrous results.
 32497	
 32498	#Treatment of Acute Abscesses.#--The dictum of John Bell, "Where there
 32499	is pus, let it out," summarises the treatment of abscess. The extent and
 32500	situation of the incision and the means taken to drain the cavity,
 32501	however, vary with the nature, site, and relations of the abscess. In a
 32502	superficial abscess, for example a bubo, or an abscess in the breast or
 32503	face where a disfiguring scar is undesirable, a small puncture should be
 32504	made where the pus threatens to point, and a Klapp's suction bell be
 32505	applied as already described (p. 39). A drain is not necessary, and in
 32506	the intervals between the applications of the bell the part is covered
 32507	with a moist antiseptic dressing.
 32508	
 32509	In abscesses deeply placed, as for example under the gluteal or pectoral
 32510	muscles, one or more incisions should be made, and the cavity drained by
 32511	glass or rubber tubes or by strips of rubber tissue.
 32512	
 32513	The wound should be dressed the next day, and the tube shortened, in the
 32514	case of a rubber tube, by cutting off a portion of its outer end. On the
 32515	second day or later, according to circumstances, the tube is removed,
 32516	and after this the dressing need not be repeated oftener than every
 32517	second or third day.
 32518	
 32519	Where pus has formed in relation to important structures--as, for
 32520	example, in the deeper planes of the neck--_Hilton's method_ of opening
 32521	the abscess may be employed. An incision is made through the skin and
 32522	fascia, a grooved director is gently pushed through the deeper tissues
 32523	till pus escapes along its groove, and then the track is widened by
 32524	passing in a pair of dressing forceps and expanding the blades. A tube,
 32525	or strip of rubber tissue, is introduced, and the subsequent treatment
 32526	carried out as in other abscesses. When the drain lies in proximity to a
 32527	large blood vessel, care must be taken not to leave it in position long
 32528	enough to cause ulceration of the vessel wall by pressure.
 32529	
 32530	In some abscesses, such as those in the vicinity of the anus, the cavity
 32531	should be laid freely open in its whole extent, stuffed with iodoform or
 32532	bismuth gauze, and treated by the open method.
 32533	
 32534	It is seldom advisable to wash out an abscess cavity, and squeezing out
 32535	the pus is also to be avoided, lest the protective zone be broken down
 32536	and the infection be diffused into the surrounding tissues.
 32537	
 32538	The importance of taking precautions against further infection in
 32539	opening an abscess can scarcely be exaggerated, and the rapidity with
 32540	which healing occurs when the access of fresh bacteria is prevented is
 32541	in marked contrast to what occurs when such precautions are neglected
 32542	and further infection is allowed to take place.
 32543	
 32544	_Acute Suppuration in a Wound._--If in the course of an operation
 32545	infection of the wound has occurred, a marked inflammatory reaction soon
 32546	manifests itself, and the same changes as occur in the formation of an
 32547	acute abscess take place, modified, however, by the fact that the pus
 32548	can more readily reach the surface. In from twenty-four to forty-eight
 32549	hours the patient is conscious of a sensation of chilliness, or may
 32550	even have a rigor. At the same time he feels generally out of sorts,
 32551	with impaired appetite, headache, and it may be looseness of the bowels.
 32552	His temperature rises to 100 o or 101 o F., and the pulse quickens to 100
 32553	or 110.
 32554	
 32555	On exposing the wound it is found that the parts for some distance
 32556	around are red, glazed, and oedematous. The discoloration and swelling
 32557	are most intense in the immediate vicinity of the wound, the edges of
 32558	which are everted and moist. Any stitches that may have been introduced
 32559	are tight, and the deep ones may be cutting into the tissues. There is
 32560	heat, and a constant burning or throbbing pain, which is increased by
 32561	pressure. If the stitches be cut, pus escapes, the wound gapes, and its
 32562	surfaces are found to be inflamed and covered with pus.
 32563	
 32564	The open method is the only safe means of treating such wounds. The
 32565	infected surface may be sponged over with pure carbolic acid, the excess
 32566	of which is washed off with absolute alcohol, and the wound either
 32567	drained by tubes or packed with iodoform gauze. The practice of scraping
 32568	such surfaces with the sharp spoon, squeezing or even of washing them
 32569	out with antiseptic lotions, is attended with the risk of further
 32570	diffusing the organisms in the tissue, and is only to be employed under
 32571	exceptional circumstances. Continuous irrigation of infected wounds or
 32572	their immersion in antiseptic baths is sometimes useful. The free
 32573	opening up of the wound is almost immediately followed by a fall in the
 32574	temperature. The surrounding inflammation subsides, the discharge of pus
 32575	lessens, and healing takes place by the formation of granulation
 32576	tissue--the so-called "healing by second intention."
 32577	
 32578	Wound infection may take place from _catgut_ which has not been
 32579	efficiently prepared. The local and general reactions may be slight,
 32580	and, as a rule, do not appear for seven or eight days after the
 32581	operation, and, it may be, not till after the skin edges have united.
 32582	The suppuration is strictly localised to the part of the wound where
 32583	catgut was employed for stitches or ligatures, and shows little tendency
 32584	to spread. The infected part, however, is often long of healing. The
 32585	irritation in these cases is probably due to toxins in the catgut and
 32586	not to bacteria.
 32587	
 32588	When suppuration occurs in connection with buried sutures of
 32589	unabsorbable materials, such as silk, silkworm gut, or silver wire, it
 32590	is apt to persist till the foreign material is cast off or removed.
 32591	
 32592	Suppuration may occur in the track of a skin stitch, producing a _stitch
 32593	abscess_. The infection may arise from the material used, especially
 32594	catgut or silk, or, more frequently perhaps, from the growth of
 32595	staphylococcus albus from the skin of the patient when this has been
 32596	imperfectly disinfected. The formation of pus under these conditions may
 32597	not be attended with any of the usual signs of suppuration, and beyond
 32598	some induration around the wound and a slight tenderness on pressure
 32599	there may be nothing to suggest the presence of an abscess.
 32600	
 32601	_Acute Suppuration of a Mucous Membrane._--When pyogenic organisms gain
 32602	access to a mucous membrane, such as that of the bladder, urethra, or
 32603	middle ear, the usual phenomena of acute inflammation and suppuration
 32604	ensue, followed by the discharge of pus on the free surface. It would
 32605	appear that the most marked changes take place in the submucous tissue,
 32606	causing the covering epithelium in places to die and leave small
 32607	superficial ulcers, for example in gonorrhoeal urethritis, the
 32608	cicatricial contraction of the scar subsequently leading to the
 32609	formation of stricture. When mucous glands are present in the membrane,
 32610	the pus is mixed with mucus--_muco-pus_.
 32611	
 32612	
 32613	DIFFUSE CELLULITIS AND DIFFUSE SUPPURATION
 32614	
 32615	Cellulitis is an acute affection resulting from the introduction of some
 32616	organism--commonly the _streptococcus pyogenes_--into the cellular
 32617	connective tissue of the integument, intermuscular septa, tendon
 32618	sheaths, or other structures. Infection always takes place through a
 32619	breach of the surface, although this may be superficial and
 32620	insignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail,
 32621	and the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation
 32622	becomes manifest. The cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance
 32623	from the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the
 32624	lymphatics.
 32625	
 32626	The virulence of the organisms, the loose, open nature of the tissues in
 32627	which they develop, and the free lymphatic circulation by means of which
 32628	they are spread, account for the diffuse nature of the process.
 32629	Sometimes numbers of cocci are carried for a considerable distance from
 32630	the primary area before they are arrested in the lymphatics, and thus
 32631	several patches of inflammation may appear with healthy areas between.
 32632	
 32633	The pus infiltrates the meshes of the cellular tissue, there is
 32634	sloughing of considerable portions of tissue of low vitality, such as
 32635	fat, fascia, or tendon, and if the process continues for some time
 32636	several collections of pus may form.
 32637	
 32638	_Clinical Features._--The reaction in cases of diffuse cellulitis is
 32639	severe, and is usually ushered in by a distinct chill or even a rigor,
 32640	while the temperature rises to 103 o, 104 o, or 105 o F. The pulse is
 32641	proportionately increased in frequency, and is small, feeble, and often
 32642	irregular. The face is flushed, the tongue dry and brown, and the
 32643	patient may become delirious, especially during the night. Leucocytosis
 32644	is present in cases of moderate severity; but in severe cases the
 32645	virulence of the toxins prevents reaction taking place, and leucocytosis
 32646	is absent.
 32647	
 32648	The local manifestations vary with the relation of the seat of the
 32649	inflammation to the surface. When the superficial cellular tissue is
 32650	involved, the skin assumes a dark bluish-red colour, is swollen,
 32651	oedematous, and the seat of burning pain. To the touch it is firm, hot,
 32652	and tender. When the primary focus is in the deeper tissues, the
 32653	constitutional disturbance is aggravated, while the local signs are
 32654	delayed, and only become prominent when pus forms and approaches the
 32655	surface. It is not uncommon for blebs containing dark serous fluid to
 32656	form on the skin. The infection frequently spreads along the line of the
 32657	main lymph vessels of the part (_septic lymphangitis_) and may reach the
 32658	lymph glands (_septic lymphadenitis_).
 32659	
 32660	With the formation of pus the skin becomes soft and boggy at several
 32661	points, and eventually breaks, giving exit to a quantity of thick
 32662	grumous discharge. Sometimes several small collections under the skin
 32663	fuse, and an abscess is formed in which fluctuation can be detected.
 32664	Occasionally gases are evolved in the tissues, giving rise to emphysema.
 32665	It is common for portions of fascia, ligaments, or tendons to slough,
 32666	and this may often be recognised clinically by a peculiar crunching or
 32667	grating sensation transmitted to the fingers on making firm pressure on
 32668	the part.
 32669	
 32670	If it is not let out by incision, the pus, travelling along the lines of
 32671	least resistance, tends to point at several places on the surface, or to
 32672	open into joints or other cavities.
 32673	
 32674	_Prognosis._--The occurrence of _septicaemia_ is the most serious risk,
 32675	and it is in cases of diffuse suppurative cellulitis that this form of
 32676	blood-poisoning assumes its most aggravated forms. The toxins of the
 32677	streptococci are exceedingly virulent, and induce local death of tissue
 32678	so rapidly that the protective emigration of leucocytes fails to take
 32679	place. In some cases the passage of masses of free cocci in the
 32680	lymphatics, or of infective emboli in the blood vessels, leads to the
 32681	formation of _pyogenic abscesses_ in vital organs, such as the brain,
 32682	lungs, liver, kidneys, or other viscera. _Haemorrhage_ from erosion of
 32683	arterial or venous trunks may take place and endanger life.
 32684	
 32685	_Treatment._--The treatment of diffuse cellulitis depends to a large
 32686	extent on the situation and extent of the affected area, and on the
 32687	stage of the process.
 32688	
 32689	_In the limbs_, for example, where the application of a constricting
 32690	band is practicable, Bier's method of inducing passive hyperaemia yields
 32691	excellent results. If pus is formed, one or more small incisions are
 32692	made and a light moist dressing placed over the wounds to absorb the
 32693	discharge, but no drain is inserted. The whole of the inflamed area
 32694	should be covered with gauze wrung out of a 1 in 10 solution of ichthyol
 32695	in glycerine. The dressing is changed as often as necessary, and in the
 32696	intervals when the band is off, gentle active and passive movements
 32697	should be carried out to prevent the formation of adhesions. After
 32698	incisions have been made, we have found the _immersion_ of the limb, for
 32699	a few hours at a time, in a water-bath containing warm boracic lotion or
 32700	eusol a useful adjuvant to the passive hyperaemia.
 32701	
 32702	_Continuous irrigation_ of the part by a slow, steady stream of lotion,
 32703	at the body temperature, such as eusol, or Dakin's solution, or boracic
 32704	acid, or frequent washing with peroxide of hydrogen, has been found of
 32705	value.
 32706	
 32707	A suitably arranged splint adds to the comfort of the patient; and the
 32708	limb should be placed in the attitude which, in the event of stiffness
 32709	resulting, will least interfere with its usefulness. The elbow, for
 32710	example, should be flexed to a little less than a right angle; at the
 32711	wrist, the hand should be dorsiflexed and the fingers flexed slightly
 32712	towards the palm.
 32713	
 32714	Massage, passive movement, hot and cold douching, and other measures,
 32715	may be necessary to get rid of the chronic oedema, adhesions of tendons,
 32716	and stiffness of joints which sometimes remain.
 32717	
 32718	In situations where a constricting band cannot be applied, for example,
 32719	on the trunk or the neck, Klapp's suction bells may be used, small
 32720	incisions being made to admit of the escape of pus.
 32721	
 32722	If these measures fail or are impracticable, it may be necessary to make
 32723	one or more free incisions, and to insert drainage-tubes, portions of
 32724	rubber dam, or iodoform worsted.
 32725	
 32726	The general treatment of toxaemia must be carried out, and in cases due
 32727	to infection by streptococci, anti-streptococcic serum may be used.
 32728	
 32729	In a few cases, amputation well above the seat of disease, by removing
 32730	the source of toxin production, offers the only means of saving the
 32731	patient.
 32732	
 32733	
 32734	WHITLOW
 32735	
 32736	The clinical term whitlow is applied to an acute infection, usually
 32737	followed by suppuration, commonly met with in the fingers, less
 32738	frequently in the toes. The point of infection is often trivial--a
 32739	pin-prick, a puncture caused by a splinter of wood, a scratch, or even
 32740	an imperceptible lesion of the skin.
 32741	
 32742	Several varieties of whitlow are recognised, but while it is convenient
 32743	to describe them separately, it is to be clearly understood that
 32744	clinically they merge one into another, and it is not always possible to
 32745	determine in which connective-tissue plane a given infection has
 32746	originated.
 32747	
 32748	_Initial Stage._--Attention is usually first attracted to the condition
 32749	by a sensation of tightness in the finger and tenderness when the part
 32750	is squeezed or knocked against anything. In the course of a few hours
 32751	the part becomes red and swollen; there is continuous pain, which soon
 32752	assumes a throbbing character, particularly when the hand is dependent,
 32753	and may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and the patient may feel
 32754	generally out of sorts.
 32755	
 32756	If a constricting band is applied at this stage, the infection can
 32757	usually be checked and the occurrence of suppuration prevented. If this
 32758	fails, or if the condition is allowed to go untreated, the inflammatory
 32759	reaction increases and terminates in suppuration, giving rise to one or
 32760	other of the forms of whitlow to be described.
 32761	
 32762	_The Purulent Blister._--In the most superficial variety, pus forms
 32763	between the rete Malpighii and the stratum corneum of the skin, the
 32764	latter being raised as a blister in which fluctuation can be detected
 32765	(Fig. 9, a). This is commonly met with in the palm of the hand of
 32766	labouring men who have recently resumed work after a spell of idleness.
 32767	When the blister forms near the tip of the finger, the pus burrows under
 32768	the nail--which corresponds to the stratum corneum--raising it from its
 32769	bed.
 32770	
 32771	There is some local heat and discoloration, and considerable pain and
 32772	tenderness, but little or no constitutional disturbance. Superficial
 32773	lymphangitis may extend a short distance up the forearm. By clipping
 32774	away the raised epidermis, and if necessary the nail, the pus is allowed
 32775	to escape, and healing speedily takes place.
 32776	
 32777	_Whitlow at the Nail Fold._--This variety, which is met with among those
 32778	who handle septic material, occurs in the sulcus between the nail and
 32779	the skin, and is due to the introduction of infective matter at the root
 32780	of the nail (Fig. 9, b). A small focus of suppuration forms under the
 32781	nail, with swelling and redness of the nail fold, causing intense pain
 32782	and discomfort, interfering with sleep, and producing a constitutional
 32783	reaction out of all proportion to the local lesion.
 32784	
 32785	To allow the pus to escape, it is necessary, under local anaesthesia, to
 32786	cut away the nail fold as well as the portion of nail in the infected
 32787	area, or, it may be, to remove the nail entirely. If only a small
 32788	opening is made in the nail it is apt to be blocked by granulations.
 32789	
 32790	[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diagram of various forms of Whitlow.
 32791	  a = Purulent blister.
 32792	  b = Suppuration at nail fold.
 32793	  c = Subcutaneous whitlow.
 32794	  d = Whitlow in sheath of flexor tendon (e). ]
 32795	
 32796	_Subcutaneous Whitlow._--In this variety the infection manifests itself
 32797	as a cellulitis of the pulp of the finger (Fig. 9, c), which sometimes
 32798	spreads towards the palm of the hand. The finger becomes red, swollen,
 32799	and tense; there is severe throbbing pain, which is usually worst at
 32800	night and prevents sleep, and the part is extremely tender on pressure.
 32801	When the palm is invaded there may be marked oedema of the back of the
 32802	hand, the dense integument of the palm preventing the swelling from
 32803	appearing on the front. The pus may be under such tension that
 32804	fluctuation cannot be detected. The patient is usually able to flex the
 32805	finger to a certain extent without increasing the pain--a point which
 32806	indicates that the tendon sheaths have not been invaded. The
 32807	suppurative process may, however, spread to the tendon sheaths, or even
 32808	to the bone. Sometimes the excessive tension and virulent toxins induce
 32809	actual gangrene of the distal part, or even of the whole finger. There
 32810	is considerable constitutional disturbance, the temperature often
 32811	reaching 101 o or 102 o F.
 32812	
 32813	The treatment consists in applying a constriction band and making an
 32814	incision over the centre of the most tender area, care being taken to
 32815	avoid opening the tendon sheath lest the infection be conveyed to it.
 32816	Moist dressings should be employed while the suppuration lasts. Carbolic
 32817	fomentations, however, are to be avoided on account of the risk of
 32818	inducing gangrene.
 32819	
 32820	_Whitlow of the Tendon Sheaths._--In this form the main incidence of the
 32821	infection is on the sheaths of the flexor tendons, but it is not always
 32822	possible to determine whether it started there or spread thither from
 32823	the subcutaneous cellular tissue (Fig. 9, d). In some cases both
 32824	connective tissue planes are involved. The affected finger becomes red,
 32825	painful, and swollen, the swelling spreading to the dorsum. The
 32826	involvement of the tendon sheath is usually indicated by the patient
 32827	being unable to flex the finger, and by the pain being increased when he
 32828	attempts to do so. On account of the anatomical arrangement of the
 32829	tendon sheaths, the process may spread into the forearm--directly in the
 32830	case of the thumb and little finger, and after invading the palm in the
 32831	case of the other fingers--and there give rise to a diffuse cellulitis
 32832	which may result in sloughing of fasciae and tendons. When the infection
 32833	spreads into the common flexor sheath under the transverse carpal
 32834	(anterior annular) ligament, it is not uncommon for the intercarpal and
 32835	wrist joints to become implicated. Impaired movement of tendons and
 32836	joints is, therefore, a common sequel to this variety of whitlow.
 32837	
 32838	The _treatment_ consists in inducing passive hyperaemia by Bier's method,
 32839	and, if this is done early, suppuration may be avoided. If pus forms,
 32840	small incisions are made, under local anaesthesia, to relieve the tension
 32841	in the sheath and to diminish the risk of the tendons sloughing. No form
 32842	of drain should be inserted. In the fingers the incisions should be made
 32843	in the middle line, and in the palm they should be made over the
 32844	metacarpal bones to avoid the digital vessels and nerves. If pus has
 32845	spread under the transverse carpal ligament, the incision must be made
 32846	above the wrist. Passive movements and massage must be commenced as
 32847	early as possible and be perseveringly employed to diminish the
 32848	formation of adhesions and resulting stiffness.
 32849	
 32850	_Subperiosteal Whitlow._--This form is usually an extension of the
 32851	subcutaneous or of the thecal variety, but in some cases the
 32852	inflammation begins in the periosteum--usually of the terminal phalanx.
 32853	It may lead to necrosis of a portion or even of the entire phalanx. This
 32854	is usually recognised by the persistence of suppuration long after the
 32855	acute symptoms have passed off, and by feeling bare bone with the probe.
 32856	In such cases one or more of the joints are usually implicated also, and
 32857	lateral mobility and grating may be elicited. Recovery does not take
 32858	place until the dead bone is removed, and the usefulness of the finger
 32859	is often seriously impaired by fibrous or bony ankylosis of the
 32860	interphalangeal joints. This may render amputation advisable when a
 32861	stiff finger is likely to interfere with the patient's occupation.
 32862	
 32863	
 32864	SUPPURATIVE CELLULITIS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
 32865	
 32866	_Cellulitis of the forearm_ is usually a sequel to one of the deeper
 32867	varieties of whitlow.
 32868	
 32869	In the _region of the elbow-joint_, cellulitis is common around the
 32870	olecranon. It may originate as an inflammation of the olecranon bursa,
 32871	or may invade the bursa secondarily. In exceptional cases the
 32872	elbow-joint is also involved.
 32873	
 32874	Cellulitis of the _axilla_ may originate in suppuration in the lymph
 32875	glands, following an infected wound of the hand, or it may spread from a
 32876	septic wound on the chest wall or in the neck. In some cases it is
 32877	impossible to discover the primary seat of infection. A firm, brawny
 32878	swelling forms in the armpit and extends on to the chest wall. It is
 32879	attended with great pain, which is increased on moving the arm, and
 32880	there is marked constitutional disturbance. When suppuration occurs, its
 32881	spread is limited by the attachments of the axillary fascia, and the pus
 32882	tends to burrow on to the chest wall beneath the pectoral muscles, and
 32883	upwards towards the shoulder-joint, which may become infected. When the
 32884	pus forms in the axillary space, the treatment consists in making free
 32885	incisions, which should be placed on the thoracic side of the axilla to
 32886	avoid the axillary vessels and nerves. If the pus spreads on to the
 32887	chest wall, the abscess should be opened below the clavicle by Hilton's
 32888	method, and a counter opening may be made in the axilla.
 32889	
 32890	Cellulitis of the _sole of the foot_ may follow whitlow of the toes.
 32891	
 32892	In the _region of the ankle_ cellulitis is not common; but _around the
 32893	knee_ it frequently occurs in relation to the prepatellar bursa and to
 32894	the popliteal lymph glands, and may endanger the knee-joint. It is also
 32895	met with in the _groin_ following on inflammation and suppuration of the
 32896	inguinal glands, and cases are recorded in which the sloughing process
 32897	has implicated the femoral vessels and led to secondary haemorrhage.
 32898	
 32899	Cellulitis of the scalp, orbit, neck, pelvis, and perineum will be
 32900	considered with the diseases of these regions.
 32901	
 32902	
 32903	CHRONIC SUPPURATION
 32904	
 32905	While it is true that a chronic pyogenic abscess is sometimes met
 32906	with--for example, in the breast and in the marrow of long bones--in the
 32907	great majority of instances the formation of a chronic or cold abscess
 32908	is the result of the action of the tubercle bacillus. It is therefore
 32909	more convenient to study this form of suppuration with tuberculosis
 32910	(p. 139).
 32911	
 32912	
 32913	SINUS AND FISTULA
 32914	
 32915	#Sinus.#--A sinus is a track leading from a focus of suppuration to a
 32916	cutaneous or mucous surface. It usually represents the path by which the
 32917	discharge escapes from an abscess cavity that has been prevented from
 32918	closing completely, either from mechanical causes or from the persistent
 32919	formation of discharge which must find an exit. A sinus is lined by
 32920	granulation tissue, and when it is of long standing the opening may be
 32921	dragged below the level of the surrounding skin by contraction of the
 32922	scar tissue around it. As a sinus will persist until the obstacle to
 32923	closure of the original abscess is removed, it is necessary that this
 32924	should be sought for. It may be a foreign body, such as a piece of dead
 32925	bone, an infected ligature, or a bullet, acting mechanically or by
 32926	keeping up discharge, and if the body is removed the sinus usually
 32927	heals. The presence of a foreign body is often suggested by a mass of
 32928	redundant granulations at the mouth of the sinus. If a sinus passes
 32929	through a muscle, the repeated contractions tend to prevent healing
 32930	until the muscle is kept at rest by a splint, or put out of action by
 32931	division of its fibres. The sinuses associated with empyema are
 32932	prevented from healing by the rigidity of the chest wall, and will only
 32933	close after an operation which admits of the cavity being obliterated.
 32934	In any case it is necessary to disinfect the track, and, it may be, to
 32935	remove the unhealthy granulations lining it, by means of the sharp
 32936	spoon, or to excise it bodily. To encourage healing from the bottom the
 32937	cavity should be packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze. The healing of
 32938	long and tortuous sinuses is often hastened by the injection of Beck's
 32939	bismuth paste (p. 145). If disfigurement is likely to follow from
 32940	cicatricial contraction--for example, in a sinus over the lower jaw
 32941	associated with a carious tooth--the sinus should be excised and the raw
 32942	surfaces approximated with stitches.
 32943	
 32944	The _tuberculous sinus_ is described under Tuberculosis.
 32945	
 32946	A #fistula# is an abnormal canal passing from a mucous surface to the
 32947	skin or to another mucous surface. Fistulae resulting from suppuration
 32948	usually occur near the natural openings of mucous canals--for example,
 32949	on the cheek, as a salivary fistula; beside the inner angle of the eye,
 32950	as a lacrymal fistula; near the ear, as a mastoid fistula; or close to
 32951	the anus, as a fistula-in-ano. Intestinal fistulae are sometimes met with
 32952	in the abdominal wall after strangulated hernia, operations for
 32953	appendicitis, tuberculous peritonitis, and other conditions. In the
 32954	perineum, fistulae frequently complicate stricture of the urethra.
 32955	
 32956	Fistulae also occur between the bladder and vagina (_vesico-vaginal
 32957	fistula_), or between the bladder and the rectum (_recto-vesical
 32958	fistula_).
 32959	
 32960	The _treatment_ of these various forms of fistula will be described in
 32961	the sections dealing with the regions in which they occur.
 32962	
 32963	_Congenital fistulae_, such as occur in the neck from imperfect closure
 32964	of branchial clefts, or in the abdomen from unobliterated foetal ducts
 32965	such as the urachus or Meckel's diverticulum, will be described in their
 32966	proper places.

 32968	
 32969	CONSTITUTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PYOGENIC INFECTION
 32970	
 32971	We have here to consider under the terms Sapraemia, Septicaemia, and
 32972	Pyaemia certain general effects of pyogenic infection, which, although
 32973	their clinical manifestations may vary, are all associated with the
 32974	action of the same forms of bacteria. They may occur separately or in
 32975	combination, or one may follow on and merge into another.
 32976	
 32977	#Sapraemia#, or septic intoxication, is the name applied to a form of
 32978	poisoning resulting from the absorption into the blood of the toxic
 32979	products of pyogenic bacteria. These products, which are of the nature
 32980	of alkaloids, act immediately on their entrance into the circulation,
 32981	and produce effects in direct proportion to the amount absorbed. As the
 32982	toxins are gradually eliminated from the body the symptoms abate, and if
 32983	no more are introduced they disappear. Sapraemia in these respects,
 32984	therefore, is comparable to poisoning by any other form of alkaloid,
 32985	such as strychnin or morphin.
 32986	
 32987	_Clinical Features._--The symptoms of sapraemia seldom manifest
 32988	themselves within twenty-four hours of an operation or injury, because
 32989	it takes some time for the bacteria to produce a sufficient dose of
 32990	their poisons. The onset of the condition is marked by a feeling of
 32991	chilliness, sometimes amounting to a rigor, and a rise of temperature to
 32992	102 o, 103 o, or 104 o F., with morning remissions (Fig. 10). The heart's
 32993	action is markedly depressed, and the pulse is soft and compressible.
 32994	The appetite is lost, the tongue dry and covered with a thin
 32995	brownish-red fur, so that it has the appearance of "dried beef." The
 32996	urine is scanty and loaded with urates. In severe cases diarrhoea and
 32997	vomiting of dark coffee-ground material are often prominent features.
 32998	Death is usually impending when the skin becomes cold and clammy, the
 32999	mucous membranes livid, the pulse feeble and fluttering, the discharges
 33000	involuntary, and when a low form of muttering delirium is present.
 33001	
 33002	[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Charts of Acute sapraemia from (a) case of
 33003	crushed foot, and (b) case of incomplete abortion.]
 33004	
 33005	A local form of septic infection is always present--it may be an
 33006	abscess, an infected compound fracture, or an infection of the cavity of
 33007	the uterus, for example, from a retained portion of placenta.
 33008	
 33009	_Treatment._--The first indication is the immediate and complete removal
 33010	of the infected material. The wound must be freely opened, all
 33011	blood-clot, discharge, or necrosed tissue removed, and the area
 33012	disinfected by washing with sterilised salt solution, peroxide of
 33013	hydrogen, or eusol. Stronger lotions are to be avoided as being likely
 33014	to depress the tissues, and so interfere with protective phagocytosis.
 33015	On account of its power of neutralising toxins, iodoform is useful in
 33016	these cases, and is best employed by packing the wound with iodoform
 33017	gauze, and treating it by the open method, if this is possible.
 33018	
 33019	The general treatment is carried out on the same lines as for other
 33020	infective conditions.
 33021	
 33022	#Chronic sapraemia or Hectic Fever.#--Hectic fever differs from acute
 33023	sapraemia merely in degree. It usually occurs in connection with
 33024	tuberculous conditions, such as bone or joint disease, psoas abscess, or
 33025	empyema, which have opened externally, and have thereby become infected
 33026	with pyogenic organisms. It is gradual in its development, and is of a
 33027	mild type throughout.
 33028	
 33029	[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Chart of Hectic Fever.]
 33030	
 33031	The pulse is small, feeble, and compressible, and the temperature rises
 33032	in the afternoon or evening to 102 o or 103 o F. (Fig. 11), the cheeks
 33033	becoming characteristically flushed. In the early morning the
 33034	temperature falls to normal or below it, and the patient breaks into a
 33035	profuse perspiration, which leaves him pale, weak, and exhausted. He
 33036	becomes rapidly and markedly emaciated, even although in some cases the
 33037	appetite remains good and is even voracious.
 33038	
 33039	The poisons circulating in the blood produce _waxy degeneration_ in
 33040	certain viscera, notably the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. The
 33041	process begins in the arterial walls, and spreads thence to the
 33042	connective-tissue structures, causing marked enlargement of the affected
 33043	organs. Albuminuria, ascites, oedema of the lower limbs, clubbing of the
 33044	fingers, and diarrhoea are among the most prominent symptoms of this
 33045	condition.
 33046	
 33047	The _prognosis_ in hectic fever depends on the completeness with which
 33048	the further absorption of toxins can be prevented. In many cases this
 33049	can only be effected by an operation which provides for free drainage,
 33050	and, if possible, the removal of infected tissues. The resulting wound
 33051	is best treated by the open method. Even advanced waxy degeneration does
 33052	not contra-indicate this line of treatment, as the diseased organs
 33053	usually recover if the focus from which absorption of toxic material is
 33054	taking place is completely eradicated.
 33055	
 33056	[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Chart of case of Septicaemia followed by
 33057	Pyaemia.]
 33058	
 33059	#Septicaemia.#--This form of blood-poisoning is the result of the action
 33060	of pyogenic bacteria, which not only produce their toxins at the primary
 33061	seat of infection, but themselves enter the blood-stream and are carried
 33062	to other parts, where they settle and produce further effects.
 33063	
 33064	_Clinical Features._--There may be an incubation period of some hours
 33065	between the infection and the first manifestation of acute septicaemia.
 33066	In such conditions as acute osteomyelitis or acute peritonitis, we see
 33067	the most typical clinical pictures of this condition. The onset is
 33068	marked by a chill, or a rigor, which may be repeated, while the
 33069	temperature rises to 103 o or 104 o F., although in very severe cases the
 33070	temperature may remain subnormal throughout, the virulence of the toxins
 33071	preventing reaction. It is in the general appearance of the patient and
 33072	in the condition of the pulse that we have our best guides as to the
 33073	severity of the condition. If the pulse remains firm, full, and regular,
 33074	and does not exceed 110 or even 120, while the temperature is moderately
 33075	raised, the outlook is hopeful; but when the pulse becomes small and
 33076	compressible, and reaches 130 or more, especially if at the same time
 33077	the temperature is low, a grave prognosis is indicated. The tongue is
 33078	often dry and coated with a black crust down the centre, while the sides
 33079	are red. It is a good omen when the tongue becomes moist again. Thirst
 33080	is most distressing, especially in septicaemia of intestinal origin.
 33081	Persistent vomiting of dark-brown material is often present, and
 33082	diarrhoea with blood-stained stools is not uncommon. The urine is small
 33083	in amount, and contains a large proportion of urates. As the poisons
 33084	accumulate, the respiration becomes shallow and laboured, the face of a
 33085	dull ashy grey, the nose pinched, and the skin cold and clammy.
 33086	Capillary haemorrhages sometimes take place in the skin or mucous
 33087	membranes; and in a certain proportion of cases cutaneous eruptions
 33088	simulating those of scarlet fever or measles appear, and are apt to lead
 33089	to errors in diagnosis. In other cases there is slight jaundice. The
 33090	mental state is often one of complete apathy, the patient failing to
 33091	realise the gravity of his condition; sometimes there is delirium.
 33092	
 33093	The _prognosis_ is always grave, and depends on the possibility of
 33094	completely eradicating the focus of infection, and on the reserve force
 33095	the patient has to carry him over the period during which he is
 33096	eliminating the poison already circulating in his blood.
 33097	
 33098	The _treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as in sapraemia, but it
 33099	is less likely to be successful owing to the organisms having entered
 33100	the circulation. When possible, the primary focus of infection should be
 33101	dealt with.
 33102	
 33103	#Pyaemia# is a form of blood-poisoning characterised by the development
 33104	of secondary foci of suppuration in different parts of the body. Toxins
 33105	are thus introduced into the blood, not only at the primary seat of
 33106	infection, but also from each of these metastatic collections. Like
 33107	septicaemia, this condition is due to pyogenic bacteria, the
 33108	_streptococcus pyogenes_ being the commonest organism found. The primary
 33109	infection is usually in a wound--for example, a compound fracture--but
 33110	cases occur in which the point of entrance of the bacteria is not
 33111	discoverable. The dissemination of the organisms takes place through the
 33112	medium of infected emboli which form in a thrombosed vein in the
 33113	vicinity of the original lesion, and, breaking loose, are carried
 33114	thence in the blood-stream. These emboli lodge in the minute vessels of
 33115	the lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleura, brain, synovial membranes, or
 33116	cellular tissue, and the bacteria they contain give rise to secondary
 33117	foci of suppuration. Secondary abscesses are thus formed in those parts,
 33118	and these in turn may be the starting-point of new emboli which give
 33119	rise to fresh areas of pus formation. The organs above named are the
 33120	commonest situations of pyaemic abscesses, but these may also occur in
 33121	the bone marrow, the substance of muscles, the heart and pericardium,
 33122	lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or, in fact, in any tissue of the
 33123	body. Organisms circulating in the blood are prone to lodge on the
 33124	valves of the heart and give rise to endocarditis.
 33125	
 33126	[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Chart of Pyaemia following on Acute
 33127	Osteomyelitis.]
 33128	
 33129	_Clinical Features._--Before antiseptic surgery was practised, pyaemia
 33130	was a common complication of wounds. In the present day it is not only
 33131	infinitely less common, but appears also to be of a less severe type.
 33132	Its rarity and its mildness may be related as cause and effect, because
 33133	it was formerly found that pyaemia contracted from a pyaemic patient was
 33134	more virulent than that from other sources.
 33135	
 33136	In contrast with sapraemia and septicaemia, pyaemia is late of developing,
 33137	and it seldom begins within a week of the primary infection. The first
 33138	sign is a feeling of chilliness, or a violent rigor lasting for perhaps
 33139	half an hour, during which time the temperature rises to 103 o, 104 o, or
 33140	105 o F. In the course of an hour it begins to fall again, and the
 33141	patient breaks into a profuse sweat. The temperature may fall several
 33142	degrees, but seldom reaches the normal. In a few days there is a second
 33143	rigor with rise of temperature, and another remission, and such attacks
 33144	may be repeated at diminishing intervals during the course of the
 33145	illness (Figs. 12 and 13). The pulse is soft, and tends to remain
 33146	abnormally rapid even when the temperature falls nearly to normal.
 33147	
 33148	The face is flushed, and wears a drawn, anxious expression, and the eyes
 33149	are bright. A characteristic sweetish odour, which has been compared to
 33150	that of new-mown hay, can be detected in the breath and may pervade the
 33151	patient. The appetite is lost; there may be sickness and vomiting and
 33152	profuse diarrhoea; and the patient emaciates rapidly. The skin is
 33153	continuously hot, and has often a peculiar pungent feel. Patches of
 33154	erythema sometimes appear scattered over the body. The skin may assume a
 33155	dull sallow or earthy hue, or a bright yellow icteric tint may appear.
 33156	The conjunctivae also may be yellow. In the latter stages of the disease
 33157	the pulse becomes small and fluttering; the tongue becomes dry and
 33158	brown; sordes collect on the teeth; and a low muttering form of delirium
 33159	supervenes.
 33160	
 33161	Secondary infection of the parotid gland frequently occurs, and gives
 33162	rise to a suppurative parotitis. This condition is associated with
 33163	severe pain, gradually extending from behind the angle of the jaw on to
 33164	the face. There is also swelling over the gland, and eventually
 33165	suppuration and sloughing of the gland tissue and overlying skin.
 33166	
 33167	Secondary abscesses in the lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or joints
 33168	are often so insidious and painless in their development that they are
 33169	only discovered accidentally. When the abscess is evacuated, healing
 33170	often takes place with remarkable rapidity, and with little impairment
 33171	of function.
 33172	
 33173	The general symptoms may be simulated by an attack of malaria.
 33174	
 33175	_Prognosis._--The prognosis in acute pyaemia is much less hopeless than
 33176	it once was, a considerable proportion of the patients recovering. In
 33177	acute cases the disease proves fatal in ten days or a fortnight, death
 33178	being due to toxaemia. Chronic cases often run a long course, lasting for
 33179	weeks or even months, and prove fatal from exhaustion and waxy disease
 33180	following on prolonged suppuration.
 33181	
 33182	_Treatment._--In such conditions as compound fractures and severe
 33183	lacerated wounds, much can be done to avert the conditions which lead to
 33184	pyaemia, by applying a Bier's constricting bandage as soon as there is
 33185	evidence of infection having taken place, or even if there is reason to
 33186	suspect that the wound is not aseptic.
 33187	
 33188	If sepsis is already established, and evidence of general infection is
 33189	present, the wound should be opened up sufficiently to admit of thorough
 33190	disinfection and drainage, and the constricting bandage applied to aid
 33191	the defensive processes going on in the tissues. If these measures fail,
 33192	amputation of the limb may be the only means of preventing further
 33193	dissemination of infective material from the primary source of
 33194	infection.
 33195	
 33196	Attempts have been made to interrupt the channel along which the
 33197	infective emboli spread, by ligating or resecting the main vein of the
 33198	affected part, but this is seldom feasible except in the case of the
 33199	internal jugular vein for infection of the transverse sinus.
 33200	
 33201	Secondary abscesses must be aspirated or opened and drained whenever
 33202	possible.
 33203	
 33204	The general treatment is conducted on the same lines as on other forms
 33205	of pyogenic infection.

 33212	ULCERATION AND ULCERS
 33213	
 33214	
 33215	Definitions--Clinical examination of an ulcer--The healing
 33216	    sore.--Classification of ulcers--A. According to cause:
 33217	    _Traumatism_, _Imperfect circulation_, _Imperfect nerve-supply_,
 33218	    _Constitutional causes_--B. According to condition: _Healing_,
 33219	    _Stationary_, _Spreading_.--Treatment.
 33220	
 33221	The process of _ulceration_ may be defined as the molecular or cellular
 33222	death of tissue taking place on a free surface. It is essentially of the
 33223	same nature as the process of suppuration, only that the purulent
 33224	discharge, instead of collecting in a closed cavity and forming an
 33225	abscess, at once escapes on the surface.
 33226	
 33227	An _ulcer_ is an open wound or sore in which there are present certain
 33228	conditions tending to prevent it undergoing the natural process of
 33229	repair. Of these, one of the most important is the presence of
 33230	pathogenic bacteria, which by their action not only prevent healing, but
 33231	so irritate and destroy the tissues as to lead to an actual increase in
 33232	the size of the sore. Interference with the nutrition of a part by oedema
 33233	or chronic venous congestion may impede healing; as may also induration
 33234	of the surrounding area, by preventing the contraction which is such an
 33235	important factor in repair. Defective innervation, such as occurs in
 33236	injuries and diseases of the spinal cord, also plays an important part
 33237	in delaying repair. In certain constitutional conditions, too--for
 33238	example, Bright's disease, diabetes, or syphilis--the vitiated state of
 33239	the tissues is an impediment to repair. Mechanical causes, such as
 33240	unsuitable dressings or ill-fitting appliances, may also act in the same
 33241	direction.
 33242	
 33243	#Clinical Examination of an Ulcer.#--In examining any ulcer, we
 33244	observe--(1) Its _base_ or _floor_, noting the presence or absence of
 33245	granulations, their disposition, size, colour, vascularity, and whether
 33246	they are depressed or elevated in relation to the surrounding parts. (2)
 33247	The _discharge_ as to quantity, consistence, colour, composition, and
 33248	odour. (3) The _edges_, noting particularly whether or not the marginal
 33249	epithelium is attempting to grow over the surface; also their shape,
 33250	regularity, thickness, and whether undermined or overlapping, everted or
 33251	depressed. (4) The _surrounding tissues_, as to whether they are
 33252	congested, oedematous, inflamed, indurated, or otherwise. (5) Whether or
 33253	not there is _pain_ or tenderness in the raw surface or its
 33254	surroundings. (6) The _part of the body_ on which it occurs, because
 33255	certain ulcers have special seats of election--for example, the varicose
 33256	ulcer in the lower third of the leg, the perforating ulcer on the sole
 33257	of the foot, and so on.
 33258	
 33259	#The Healing Sore.#--If a portion of skin be excised aseptically, and no
 33260	attempt made to close the wound, the raw surface left is soon covered
 33261	over with a layer of coagulated blood and lymph. In the course of a few
 33262	days this is replaced by the growth of _granulations_, which are of
 33263	uniform size, of a pinkish-red colour, and moist with a slight serous
 33264	exudate containing a few dead leucocytes. They grow until they reach the
 33265	level of the surrounding skin, and so fill the gap with a fine velvety
 33266	mass of granulation tissue. At the edges, the young epithelium may be
 33267	seen spreading in over the granulations as a fine bluish-white pellicle,
 33268	which gradually covers the sore, becoming paler in colour as it
 33269	thickens, and eventually forming the smooth, non-vascular covering of
 33270	the cicatrix. There is no pain, and the surrounding parts are healthy.
 33271	
 33272	This may be used as a type with which to compare the ulcers seen at the
 33273	bedside, so that we may determine how far, and in what particulars,
 33274	these differ from the type; and that we may in addition recognise the
 33275	conditions that have to be counteracted before the characters of the
 33276	typical healing sore are assumed.
 33277	
 33278	For purposes of contrast we may indicate the characters of an open sore
 33279	in which bacterial infection with pathogenic bacteria has taken place.
 33280	The layer of coagulated blood and lymph becomes liquefied and is thrown
 33281	off, and instead of granulations being formed, the tissues exposed on
 33282	the floor of the ulcer are destroyed by the bacterial toxins, with the
 33283	formation of minute sloughs and a quantity of pus.
 33284	
 33285	The discharge is profuse, thin, acrid, and offensive, and consists of
 33286	pus, broken-down blood-clot, and sloughs. The edges are inflamed,
 33287	irregular, and ragged, showing no sign of growing epithelium--on the
 33288	contrary, the sore may be actually increasing in area by the
 33289	breaking-down of the tissues at its margins. The surrounding parts are
 33290	hot, red, swollen, and oedematous; and there is pain and tenderness both
 33291	in the sore itself and in the parts around.
 33292	
 33293	#Classification of Ulcers.#--The nomenclature of ulcers is much involved
 33294	and gives rise to great confusion, chiefly for the reason that no one
 33295	basis of classification has been adopted. Thus some ulcers are named
 33296	according to the causes at work in producing or maintaining them--for
 33297	example, the traumatic, the septic, and the varicose ulcer; some from
 33298	the constitutional element present, as the gouty and the diabetic ulcer;
 33299	and others according to the condition in which they happen to be when
 33300	seen by the surgeon, such as the weak, the inflamed, and the callous
 33301	ulcer.
 33302	
 33303	So long as we retain these names it will be impossible to find a single
 33304	basis for classification; and yet many of the terms are so descriptive
 33305	and so generally understood that it is undesirable to abolish them. We
 33306	must therefore remain content with a clinical arrangement of ulcers,--it
 33307	cannot be called a classification,--considering any given ulcer from two
 33308	points of view: first its _cause_, and second its _present condition_.
 33309	This method of studying ulcers has the practical advantage that it
 33310	furnishes us with the main indications for treatment as well as for
 33311	diagnosis: the cause must be removed, and the condition so modified as
 33312	to convert the ulcer into an aseptic healing sore.
 33313	
 33314	A. #Arrangement of Ulcers according to their Cause.#--Although any given
 33315	ulcer may be due to a combination of causes, it is convenient to
 33316	describe the following groups:
 33317	
 33318	_Ulcers due to Traumatism._--Traumatism in the form of a _crush_ or
 33319	_bruise_ is a frequent cause of ulcer formation, acting either by
 33320	directly destroying the skin, or by so diminishing its vitality that it
 33321	is rendered a suitable soil for bacteria. If these gain access, in the
 33322	course of a few days the damaged area of skin becomes of a greyish
 33323	colour, blebs form on it, and it undergoes necrosis, leaving an
 33324	unhealthy raw surface when the slough separates.
 33325	
 33326	_Heat_ and _prolonged exposure to the Rontgen rays_ or _to radium
 33327	emanations_ act in a similar way.
 33328	
 33329	The _pressure_ of improperly padded splints or other appliances may so
 33330	far interfere with the circulation of the part pressed upon, that the
 33331	skin sloughs, leaving an open sore. This is most liable to occur in
 33332	patients who suffer from some nerve lesion--such as anterior
 33333	poliomyelitis, or injury of the spinal cord or nerve-trunks.
 33334	Splint-pressure sores are usually situated over bony prominences, such
 33335	as the malleoli, the condyles of the femur or humerus, the head of the
 33336	fibula, the dorsum of the foot, or the base of the fifth metatarsal
 33337	bone. On removing the splint, the skin of the part pressed upon is found
 33338	to be of a red or pink colour, with a pale grey patch in the centre,
 33339	which eventually sloughs and leaves an ulcer. Certain forms of
 33340	_bed-sore_ are also due to prolonged pressure.
 33341	
 33342	Pressure sores are also known to have been produced artificially by
 33343	malingerers and hysterical subjects.
 33344	
 33345	[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Leg Ulcers associated with Varicose Veins and
 33346	Pigmentation of the Skin.]
 33347	
 33348	_Ulcers due to Imperfect Circulation._--Imperfect circulation is an
 33349	important causative factor in ulceration, especially when it is the
 33350	_venous return_ that is defective. This is best illustrated in the
 33351	so-called _leg ulcer_, which occurs most frequently on the front and
 33352	medial aspect of the lower third of the leg. At this point the
 33353	anastomosis between the superficial and deep veins of the leg is less
 33354	free than elsewhere, so that the extra stress thrown upon the surface
 33355	veins interferes with the nutrition of the skin (Hilton). The importance
 33356	of imperfect venous return in the causation of such ulcers is evidenced
 33357	by the fact that as soon as the condition of the circulation is improved
 33358	by confining the patient to bed and elevating the limb, the ulcer begins
 33359	to heal, even although all methods of local treatment have hitherto
 33360	proved ineffectual. In a considerable number of cases, but by no means
 33361	in all, this form of ulcer is associated with the presence of varicose
 33362	veins, and in such cases it is spoken of as the _varicose ulcer_ (Fig. 14).
 33363	The presence of varicose veins is frequently associated with a
 33364	diffuse brownish or bluish pigmentation of the skin of the lower third
 33365	of the leg, or with an obstinate form of dermatitis (_varicose eczema_),
 33366	and the scratching or rubbing of the part is liable to cause a breach of
 33367	the surface and permit of infection which leads to ulceration. Varicose
 33368	ulcers may also originate from the bursting of a small peri-phlebitic
 33369	abscess.
 33370	
 33371	Varicose veins in immediate relation to the base of a large chronic
 33372	ulcer usually become thrombosed, and in time are reduced to fibrous
 33373	cords, and therefore in such cases haemorrhage is not a common
 33374	complication. In smaller and more superficial ulcers, however, the
 33375	destructive process is liable to implicate the wall of the vessel before
 33376	the occurrence of thrombosis, and to lead to profuse and it may be
 33377	dangerous bleeding.
 33378	
 33379	These ulcers are at first small and superficial, but from want of care,
 33380	from continued standing or walking, or from injudicious treatment, they
 33381	gradually become larger and deeper. They are not infrequently multiple,
 33382	and this, together with their depth, may lead to their being mistaken
 33383	for ulcers due to syphilis. The base of the ulcer is covered with
 33384	imperfectly formed, soft, oedematous granulations, which give off a thin
 33385	sero-purulent discharge. The edges are slightly inflamed, and show no
 33386	evidence of healing. The parts around are usually pigmented and slightly
 33387	oedematous, and as a rule there is little pain. This variety of ulcer is
 33388	particularly prone to pass into the condition known as callous.
 33389	
 33390	In _anaemic_ patients, especially young girls, ulcers are occasionally
 33391	met with which have many of the clinical characters of those associated
 33392	with imperfect venous return. They are slow to heal, and tend to pass
 33393	into the condition known as weak.
 33394	
 33395	_Ulcers due to Interference with Nerve-Supply._--Any interference with
 33396	the nerve-supply of the superficial tissues predisposes to ulceration.
 33397	For example, _trophic_ ulcers are liable to occur in injuries or
 33398	diseases of the spinal cord, in cerebral paralysis, in limbs weakened by
 33399	poliomyelitis, in ascending or peripheral neuritis, or after injuries of
 33400	nerve-trunks.
 33401	
 33402	The _acute bed-sore_ is a rapidly progressing form of ulceration, often
 33403	amounting to gangrene, of portions of skin exposed to pressure when
 33404	their trophic nerve-supply has been interfered with.
 33405	
 33406	[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Perforating Ulcers of Sole of Foot.
 33407

 33409	
 33410	The _perforating ulcer of the foot_ is a peculiar type of sore which
 33411	occurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis,
 33412	and with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general
 33413	paralysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia (Fig. 15). It also occurs
 33414	in patients suffering from glycosuria, and is usually associated with
 33415	arterio-sclerosis--local or general. Perforating ulcer is met with most
 33416	frequently under the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. A
 33417	callosity forms and suppuration occurs under it, the pus escaping
 33418	through a small hole in the centre. The process slowly and gradually
 33419	spreads deeper and deeper, till eventually the bone or joint is reached,
 33420	and becomes implicated in the destructive process--hence the term
 33421	"perforating ulcer." The flexor tendons are sometimes destroyed, the toe
 33422	being dorsiflexed by the unopposed extensors. The depth of the track
 33423	being so disproportionate to its superficial area, the condition closely
 33424	simulates a tuberculous sinus, for which it is liable to be mistaken.
 33425	The raw surface is absolutely insensitive, so that the probe can be
 33426	freely employed without the patient even being aware of it or suffering
 33427	the least discomfort--a significant fact in diagnosis. The cavity is
 33428	filled with effete and decomposing epidermis, which has a most offensive
 33429	odour. The chronic and intractable character of the ulcer is due to
 33430	interference with the trophic nerve-supply of the parts, and to the fact
 33431	that the epithelium of the skin grows in and lines the track leading
 33432	down to the deepest part of the ulcer and so prevents closure. While
 33433	they are commonest on the sole of the foot and other parts subjected to
 33434	pressure, perforating ulcers are met with on the sides and dorsum of the
 33435	foot and toes, on the hands, and on other parts where no pressure has
 33436	been exerted.
 33437	
 33438	The _tuberculous ulcer_, so often seen in the neck, in the vicinity of
 33439	joints, or over the ribs and sternum, usually results from the bursting
 33440	through the skin of a tuberculous abscess. The base is soft, pale, and
 33441	covered with feeble granulations and grey shreddy sloughs. The edges are
 33442	of a dull blue or purple colour, and gradually thin out towards their
 33443	free margins, and in addition are characteristically undermined, so that
 33444	a probe can be passed for some distance between the floor of the ulcer
 33445	and the thinned-out edges. Thin, devitalised tags of skin often stretch
 33446	from side to side of the ulcer. The outline is irregular; small
 33447	perforations often occur through the skin, and a thin, watery discharge,
 33448	containing grey shreds of tuberculous debris, escapes.
 33449	
 33450	_Bazin's Disease._--This term is applied to an affection of the skin and
 33451	subcutaneous tissue which bears certain resemblances to tuberculosis. It
 33452	is met with almost exclusively between the knee and the ankle, and it
 33453	usually affects both legs. It is commonest in girls of delicate
 33454	constitution, in whose family history there is evidence of a tuberculous
 33455	taint. The patient often presents other lesions of a tuberculous
 33456	character, notably enlarged cervical glands, and phlyctenular
 33457	ophthalmia. The tubercle bacillus has rarely been found, but we have
 33458	always observed characteristic epithelioid cells and giant cells in
 33459	sections made from the edge or floor of the ulcer.
 33460	
 33461	[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Bazin's Disease in a girl aet. 16.]
 33462	
 33463	The condition begins by the formation in the skin and subcutaneous
 33464	tissue of dusky or livid nodules of induration, which soften and
 33465	ulcerate, forming small open sores with ragged and undermined edges, not
 33466	unlike those resulting from the breaking down of superficial syphilitic
 33467	gummata (Fig. 16). Fresh crops of nodules appear in the neighbourhood of
 33468	the ulcers, and in turn break down. While in the nodular stage the
 33469	affection is sometimes painful, but with the formation of the ulcer the
 33470	pain subsides.
 33471	
 33472	The disease runs a chronic course, and may slowly extend over a wide
 33473	area in spite of the usual methods of treatment. After lasting for some
 33474	months, or even years, however, it may eventually undergo spontaneous
 33475	cure. The most satisfactory treatment is to excise the affected tissues
 33476	and fill the gap with skin-grafts.
 33477	
 33478	[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Syphilitic Ulcers in region of Knee, showing
 33479	punched-out appearance and raised indurated edges.]
 33480	
 33481	The _syphilitic ulcer_ is usually formed by the breaking down of a
 33482	cutaneous or subcutaneous gumma in the tertiary stage of syphilis. When
 33483	the gummatous tissue is first exposed by the destruction of the skin or
 33484	mucous membrane covering it, it appears as a tough greyish slough,
 33485	compared to "wash leather," which slowly separates and leaves a more or
 33486	less circular, deep, punched-out gap which shows a few feeble unhealthy
 33487	granulations and small sloughs on its floor. The edges are raised and
 33488	indurated; and the discharge is thick, glairy, and peculiarly offensive.
 33489	The parts around the ulcer are congested and of a dark brown colour.
 33490	There are usually several such ulcers together, and as they tend to heal
 33491	at one part while they spread at another, the affected area assumes a
 33492	sinuous or serpiginous outline. Syphilitic ulcers may be met with in any
 33493	part of the body, but are most frequent in the upper part of the leg
 33494	(Fig. 17), especially around the knee-joint in women, and over the ribs
 33495	and sternum. On healing, they usually leave a depressed and adherent
 33496	cicatrix.
 33497	
 33498	The _scorbutic ulcer_ occurs in patients suffering from scurvy, and is
 33499	characterised by its prominent granulations, which show a marked
 33500	tendency to bleed, with the formation of clots, which dry and form a
 33501	spongy crust on the surface.
 33502	
 33503	In _gouty_ patients small ulcers which are exceedingly irritable and
 33504	painful are liable to occur.
 33505	
 33506	_Ulcers associated with Malignant Disease._--Cancer and sarcoma when
 33507	situated in the subcutaneous tissue may destroy the overlying skin so
 33508	that the substance of the tumour is exposed. The fungating masses thus
 33509	produced are sometimes spoken of as malignant ulcers, but as they are
 33510	essentially different in their nature from all other forms of ulcers,
 33511	and call for totally different treatment, it is best to consider them
 33512	along with the tumours with which they are associated. Rodent ulcer,
 33513	which is one form of cancer of the skin, will be discussed with new
 33514	growths of the skin.
 33515	
 33516	B. #Arrangement of Ulcers according to their Condition.#--Having arrived
 33517	at an opinion as to the cause of a given ulcer, and placed it in one or
 33518	other of the preceding groups, the next question to ask is, In what
 33519	condition do I find this ulcer at the present moment?
 33520	
 33521	Any ulcer is in one of three states--healing, stationary, or spreading;
 33522	although it is not uncommon to find healing going on at one part while
 33523	the destructive process is extending at another.
 33524	
 33525	_The Healing Condition._--The process of healing in an ulcer has already
 33526	been studied, and we have learned that it takes place by the formation
 33527	of granulation tissue, which becomes converted into connective tissue,
 33528	and is covered over by epithelium growing in from the edges.
 33529	
 33530	Those ulcers which are _stationary_--that is, neither healing nor
 33531	spreading--may be in one of several conditions.
 33532	
 33533	_The Weak Condition._--Any ulcer may get into a weak state from
 33534	receiving a blood supply which is defective either in quantity or in
 33535	quality. The granulations are small and smooth, and of a pale yellow or
 33536	grey colour, the discharge is small in amount, and consists of thin
 33537	serum and a few pus cells, and as this dries on the edges it forms scabs
 33538	which interfere with the growth of epithelium.
 33539	
 33540	Should the part become oedematous, either from general causes, such as
 33541	heart or kidney disease, or from local causes, such as varicose veins,
 33542	the granulations share in the oedema, and there is an abundant serous
 33543	discharge.
 33544	
 33545	The excessive use of moist dressings leads to a third variety of weak
 33546	ulcer--namely, one in which the granulations become large, soft, pale,
 33547	and flabby, projecting beyond the level of the skin and overlapping the
 33548	edges, which become pale and sodden. The term "proud flesh" is popularly
 33549	applied to such redundant granulations.
 33550	
 33551	[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Callous Ulcer, showing thickened edges and
 33552	indurated swelling of surrounding parts.]
 33553	
 33554	_The Callous Condition._--This condition is usually met with in ulcers
 33555	on the lower third of the leg, and is often associated with the presence
 33556	of varicose veins. It is chiefly met with in hospital practice. The want
 33557	of healing is mainly due to impeded venous return and to oedema and
 33558	induration of the surrounding skin and cellular tissues (Fig. 18). The
 33559	induration results from coagulation and partial organisation of the
 33560	inflammatory effusion, and prevents the necessary contraction of the
 33561	sore. The base of a callous ulcer lies at some distance below the level
 33562	of the swollen, thickened, and white edges, and presents a glazed
 33563	appearance, such granulations as are present being unhealthy and
 33564	irregular. The discharge is usually watery, and cakes in the dressing.
 33565	When from neglect and want of cleanliness the ulcer becomes inflamed,
 33566	there is considerable pain, and the discharge is purulent and often
 33567	offensive.
 33568	
 33569	The prolonged hyperaemia of the tissues in relation to a callous ulcer of
 33570	the leg often leads to changes in the underlying bones. The periosteum
 33571	is abnormally thick and vascular, the superficial layers of the bone
 33572	become injected and porous, and the bones, as a whole, are thickened. In
 33573	the macerated bone "the surface is covered with irregular,
 33574	stalactite-like processes or foliaceous masses, which, to a certain
 33575	extent, follow the line of attachment of the interosseous membrane and
 33576	of the intermuscular septa" (Cathcart) (Fig. 19). When the whole
 33577	thickness of the soft tissues is destroyed by the ulcerative process,
 33578	the area of bone that comes to form the base of the ulcer projects as a
 33579	flat, porous node, which in its turn may be eroded. These changes as
 33580	seen in the macerated specimen are often mistaken for disease
 33581	originating in the bone.
 33582	
 33583	[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Tibia and Fibula, showing changes due to
 33584	chronic ulcer of leg.]
 33585	
 33586	The _irritable condition_ is met with in ulcers which occur, as a rule,
 33587	just above the external malleolus in women of neurotic temperament. They
 33588	are small in size and have prominent granulations, and by the aid of a
 33589	probe points of excessive tenderness may be discovered. These, Hilton
 33590	believed, correspond to exposed nerve filaments.
 33591	
 33592	_Ulcers which are spreading_ may be met with in one of several
 33593	conditions.
 33594	
 33595	_The Inflamed Condition._--Any ulcer may become acutely inflamed from
 33596	the access of fresh organisms, aided by mechanical irritation from
 33597	trauma, ill-fitting splints or bandages, or want of rest, or from
 33598	chemical irritants, such as strong antiseptics. The best clinical
 33599	example of an inflamed ulcer is the venereal soft sore. The base of the
 33600	ulcer becomes red and angry-looking, the granulations disappear, and a
 33601	copious discharge of thin yellow pus, mixed with blood, escapes. Sloughs
 33602	of granulation tissue or of connective tissue may form. The edges become
 33603	red, ragged, and everted, and the ulcer increases in size by spreading
 33604	into the inflamed and oedematous surrounding tissues. Such ulcers are
 33605	frequently multiple. Pain is a constant symptom, and is often severe,
 33606	and there is usually some constitutional disturbance.
 33607	
 33608	The _phagedaenic condition_ is the result of an ulcer being infected with
 33609	specially virulent bacteria. It occurs in syphilitic ulcers, and rapidly
 33610	leads to a widespread destruction of tissue. It is also met with in the
 33611	throat in some cases of scarlet fever, and may give rise to fatal
 33612	haemorrhage by ulcerating into large blood vessels. All the local and
 33613	constitutional signs of a severe septic infection are present.
 33614	
 33615	#Treatment of Ulcers.#--An ulcer is not only an immediate cause of
 33616	suffering to the patient, crippling and incapacitating him for his work,
 33617	but is a distinct and constant menace to his health: the prolonged
 33618	discharge reduces his strength; the open sore is a possible source of
 33619	infection by the organisms of suppuration, erysipelas, or other specific
 33620	diseases; phlebitis, with formation of septic emboli, leading to pyaemia,
 33621	is liable to occur; and in old persons it is not uncommon for ulcers of
 33622	long standing to become the seat of cancer. In addition, the offensive
 33623	odour of many ulcers renders the patient a source of annoyance and
 33624	discomfort to others. The primary object of treatment in any ulcer is to
 33625	bring it into the condition of a healing sore. When this has been
 33626	effected, nature will do the rest, provided extraneous sources of
 33627	irritation are excluded.
 33628	
 33629	Steps must be taken to facilitate the venous return from the ulcerated
 33630	part, and to ensure that a sufficient supply of fresh, healthy blood
 33631	reaches it. The septic element must be eliminated by disinfecting the
 33632	ulcer and its surroundings, and any other sources of irritation must be
 33633	removed.
 33634	
 33635	If the patient's health is below par, good nourishing food, tonics, and
 33636	general hygienic treatment are indicated.
 33637	
 33638	_Management of a Healing Sore._--Perhaps the best dressing for a healing
 33639	sore is a layer of Lister's perforated oiled-silk protective, which is
 33640	made to cover the raw surface and the skin for about a quarter of an
 33641	inch beyond the margins of the sore. Over this three or four thicknesses
 33642	of sterilised gauze, wrung out of eusol, creolin, or sterilised water,
 33643	are applied, and covered by a pad of absorbent wool. As far as possible
 33644	the part should be kept at rest, and the position should be adjusted so
 33645	as to favour the circulation in the affected area.
 33646	
 33647	The dressing may be renewed at intervals, and care must be taken to
 33648	avoid any rough handling of the sore. Any discharge that lies on the
 33649	surface should be removed by a gentle stream of lotion rather than by
 33650	wiping. The area round the sore should be cleansed before the fresh
 33651	dressing is applied.
 33652	
 33653	In some cases, healing goes on more rapidly under a dressing of weak
 33654	boracic ointment (one-quarter the strength of the pharmacopoeial
 33655	preparation). The growth of epithelium may be stimulated by a 6 to 8 per
 33656	cent. ointment of scarlet-red.
 33657	
 33658	Dusting powders and poultice dressings are best avoided in the treatment
 33659	of healing sores.
 33660	
 33661	In extensive ulcers resulting from recent burns, if the granulations are
 33662	healthy and aseptic, skin-grafts may safely be placed on them directly.
 33663	If, however, their asepticity cannot be relied upon, it is necessary to
 33664	scrape away the superficial layer of the granulations, the young fibrous
 33665	tissue underneath being conserved, as it is sufficiently vascular to
 33666	nourish the grafts placed on it.
 33667	
 33668	#Treatment of Special Varieties of Ulcers.#--Before beginning to treat a
 33669	given ulcer, two questions have to be answered--first, What are the
 33670	causative conditions present? and second, In what condition do I find
 33671	the ulcer?--in other words, In what particulars does it differ from a
 33672	healthy healing sore?
 33673	
 33674	If the cause is a local one, it must be removed; if a constitutional
 33675	one, means must be taken to counteract it. This done, the condition of
 33676	the ulcer must be so modified as to bring it into the state of a healing
 33677	sore, after which it will be managed on the lines already laid down.
 33678	
 33679	#Treatment in relation to the Cause of the Ulcer.#--_Traumatic
 33680	Group._--The _prophylaxis_ of these ulcers consists in excluding
 33681	bacteria, by cleansing crushed or bruised parts, and applying sterilised
 33682	dressings and properly adjusted splints. If there is reason to fear that
 33683	the disinfection has not been complete, a Bier's constricting bandage
 33684	should be applied for some hours each day. These measures will often
 33685	prevent a grossly injured portion of skin dying, and will ensure
 33686	asepticity should it do so. In the event of the skin giving way, the
 33687	same form of dressing should be continued till the slough has separated
 33688	and a healthy granulating surface is formed. The protective dressing
 33689	appropriate to a healing sore is then substituted. _Pressure sores_ are
 33690	treated on the same lines.
 33691	
 33692	The treatment of ulcers caused by _burns and scalds_ will be described
 33693	later.
 33694	
 33695	In _ulcers of the leg due to interference with the venous return_, the
 33696	primary indication is to elevate the limb in order to facilitate the
 33697	flow of the blood in the veins, and so admit of fresh blood reaching the
 33698	part. The limb may be placed on pillows, or the foot of the bed raised
 33699	on blocks, so that the ulcer lies on a higher level than the heart.
 33700	Should varicose veins be present, the question of operative treatment
 33701	must be considered.
 33702	
 33703	When an _imperfect nerve supply_ is the main factor underlying ulcer
 33704	formation, prophylaxis is the chief consideration. In patients suffering
 33705	from spinal injuries or diseases, cerebral paralysis, or affections of
 33706	the peripheral nerves, all sources of irritation, such as ill-fitting
 33707	splints, tight bandages, moist applications, and hot bottles, should be
 33708	avoided. Any part liable to pressure, from the position of the patient
 33709	or otherwise, must be carefully protected by pads of wool, air-cushions,
 33710	or water-bags, and must be kept absolutely dry. The skin should be
 33711	hardened by daily applications of methylated spirit.
 33712	
 33713	Should an ulcer form in spite of these precautions, the mildest
 33714	antiseptics must be employed for bathing and dressing it, and as far as
 33715	possible all dressings should be dry.
 33716	
 33717	The _perforating ulcer_ of the foot calls for special treatment. To
 33718	avoid pressure on the sole of the foot, the patient must be confined to
 33719	bed. As the main local obstacle to healing is the down-growth of
 33720	epithelium along the sides of the ulcer, this must be removed by the
 33721	knife or sharp spoon. The base also should be excised, and any bone
 33722	which may have become involved should be gouged away, so as to leave a
 33723	healthy and vascular surface. The cavity thus formed is stuffed with
 33724	bismuth or iodoform gauze and encouraged to heal from the bottom. As the
 33725	parts are insensitive an anaesthetic is not required. After the ulcer has
 33726	healed, the patient should wear in his boot a thick felt sole with a
 33727	hole cut out opposite the situation of the cicatrix. When a joint has
 33728	been opened into, the difficulty of thoroughly getting rid of all
 33729	unhealthy and infected granulations is so great that amputation may be
 33730	advisable, but it is to be remembered that ulceration may recur in the
 33731	stump if pressure is put upon it. The treatment of any nervous disease
 33732	or glycosuria which may coexist is, of course, indicated.
 33733	
 33734	Exposure of the plantar nerves by an incision behind the medial
 33735	malleolus, and subjecting them to forcible stretching, has been employed
 33736	by Chipault and others in the treatment of perforating ulcers of the
 33737	foot.
 33738	
 33739	The ulcer that forms in relation to callosities on the sole of the foot
 33740	is treated by paring away all the thickened skin, after softening it
 33741	with soda fomentations, removing the unhealthy granulations, and
 33742	applying stimulating dressings.
 33743	
 33744	_Treatment of Ulcers due to Constitutional Causes._--When ulcers are
 33745	associated with such diseases as tuberculosis, syphilis, diabetes,
 33746	Bright's disease, scurvy, or gout, these must receive appropriate
 33747	treatment.
 33748	
 33749	The local treatment of the _tuberculous ulcer_ calls for special
 33750	mention. If the ulcer is of limited extent and situated on an exposed
 33751	part of the body, the most satisfactory method is complete removal, by
 33752	means of the knife, scissors, or sharp spoon, of the ulcerated surface
 33753	and of all the infected area around it, so as to leave a healthy surface
 33754	from which granulations may spring up. Should the raw surface left be
 33755	likely to result in an unsightly scar or in cicatricial contraction,
 33756	skin-grafting should be employed.
 33757	
 33758	For extensive ulcers on the limbs, the chest wall, or on other covered
 33759	parts, or when operative treatment is contra-indicated, the use of
 33760	tuberculin and exposure to the Rontgen rays have proved beneficial. The
 33761	induction of passive hyperaemia, by Bier's or by Klapp's apparatus,
 33762	should also be used, either alone or supplementary to other measures.
 33763	
 33764	No ulcerative process responds so readily to medicinal treatment as the
 33765	_syphilitic ulcer_ does to the intra-venous administration of arsenical
 33766	preparations of the "606" or "914" groups or to full doses of iodide of
 33767	potassium and mercury, and the local application of black wash. When the
 33768	ulceration has lasted for a long time, however, and is widespread and
 33769	deep, the duration of treatment is materially shortened by a thorough
 33770	scraping with the sharp spoon.
 33771	
 33772	#Treatment in relation to the Condition of the Ulcer.#--_Ulcers in a
 33773	weak condition._--If the weak condition of the ulcer is due to anaemia
 33774	or kidney disease, these affections must first be treated. Locally, the
 33775	imperfect granulations should be scraped away, and some stimulating
 33776	agent applied to the raw surface to promote the growth of healthy
 33777	granulations. For this purpose the sore may be covered with gauze
 33778	smeared with a 6 to 8 per cent. ointment of scarlet-red, the surrounding
 33779	parts being protected from the irritant action of the scarlet-red by a
 33780	layer of vaseline. A dressing of gauze moistened with eusol or of
 33781	boracic lint wrung out of red lotion (2 grains of sulphate of zinc, and
 33782	10 minims of compound tincture of lavender, to an ounce of water), and
 33783	covered with a layer of gutta-percha tissue, is also useful.
 33784	
 33785	When the condition has resulted from the prolonged use of moist
 33786	dressings, these must be stopped, the redundant granulations clipped
 33787	away with scissors, the surface rubbed with silver nitrate or sulphate
 33788	of copper (blue-stone), and dry dressings applied.
 33789	
 33790	When the ulcer has assumed the characters of a healing sore, skin-grafts
 33791	may be applied to hasten cicatrisation.
 33792	
 33793	_Ulcers in a callous condition_ call for treatment in three
 33794	directions--(1) The infective element must be eliminated. When the ulcer
 33795	is foul, relays of charcoal poultices (three parts of linseed meal to
 33796	one of charcoal), maintained for thirty-six to forty-eight hours, are
 33797	useful as a preliminary step. The base of the ulcer and the thickened
 33798	edges should then be freely scraped with a sharp spoon, and the
 33799	resulting raw surface sponged over with undiluted carbolic acid or
 33800	iodine, after which an antiseptic dressing is applied, and changed daily
 33801	till healthy granulations appear. (2) The venous return must be
 33802	facilitated by elevation of the limb and massage. (3) The induration of
 33803	the surrounding parts must be got rid of before contraction of the sore
 33804	is possible. For this purpose the free application of blisters, as first
 33805	recommended by Syme, leaves little to be desired. Liquor epispasticus
 33806	painted over the parts, or a large fly-blister (emplastrum cantharidis)
 33807	applied all round the ulcer, speedily disperses the inflammatory
 33808	products which cause the induration. The use of elastic pressure or of
 33809	strapping, of hot-air baths, or the making of multiple incisions in the
 33810	skin around the ulcer, fulfils the same object.
 33811	
 33812	As soon as the ulcer assumes the characters of a healing sore, it should
 33813	be covered with skin-grafts, which furnish a much better cicatrix than
 33814	that which forms when the ulcer is allowed to heal without such aid.
 33815	
 33816	A more radical method of treatment consists in excising the whole
 33817	ulcer, including its edges and about a quarter of an inch of the
 33818	surrounding tissue, as well as the underlying fibrous tissue, and
 33819	grafting the raw surface.
 33820	
 33821	_Ambulatory Treatment._--When the circumstances of the patient forbid
 33822	his lying up in bed, the healing of the ulcer is much delayed. He should
 33823	be instructed to take every possible opportunity of placing the limb in
 33824	an elevated position, and must constantly wear a firm bandage of
 33825	_elastic webbing_. This webbing is porous and admits of evaporation of
 33826	the skin and wound secretions--an advantage it has over Martin's rubber
 33827	bandage. The bandage should extend from the toes to well above the knee,
 33828	and should always be applied while the patient is in the recumbent
 33829	position with the leg elevated, preferably before getting out of bed in
 33830	the morning. Additional support is given to the veins if the bandage is
 33831	applied as a figure of eight.
 33832	
 33833	We have found the following method satisfactory in out-patient
 33834	practice. The patient lying on a couch, the limb is raised about
 33835	eighteen inches and kept in this position for five minutes--till the
 33836	excess of blood has left it. With the limb still raised, the ulcer with
 33837	the surrounding skin is covered with a layer, about half an inch thick,
 33838	of finely powdered boracic acid, and the leg, from foot to knee,
 33839	excluding the sole, is enveloped in a thick layer of wood-wool wadding.
 33840	This is held in position by ordinary cotton bandages, painted over with
 33841	liquid starch; while the starch is drying the limb is kept elevated.
 33842	With this appliance the patient may continue to work, and the dressing
 33843	does not require to be changed oftener than once in three or four weeks
 33844	(W. G. Richardson).
 33845	
 33846	When an ulcer becomes acutely _inflamed_ as a result of superadded
 33847	infection, antiseptic measures are employed to overcome the infection,
 33848	and ichthyol or other soothing applications may be used to allay the
 33849	pain.
 33850	
 33851	The _phagedaenic ulcer_ calls for more energetic means of disinfection;
 33852	the whole of the affected surface is touched with the actual cautery at
 33853	a white heat, or is painted with pure carbolic acid. Relays of charcoal
 33854	poultices are then applied until the spread of the disease is arrested.
 33855	
 33856	For the _irritable ulcer_ the most satisfactory treatment is complete
 33857	excision and subsequent skin-grafting.

 33877	
 33878	Gangrene or mortification is the process by which a portion of tissue
 33879	dies _en masse_, as distinguished from the molecular or cellular death
 33880	which constitutes ulceration. The dead portion is known as a _slough_.
 33881	
 33882	In this chapter we shall confine our attention to the process as it
 33883	affects the limbs and superficial parts, leaving gangrene of the viscera
 33884	to be described in regional surgery.
 33885	
 33886	
 33887	TYPES OF GANGRENE
 33888	
 33889	Two distinct types of gangrene are met with, which, from their most
 33890	obvious point of difference, are known respectively as _dry_ and
 33891	_moist_, and there are several clinical varieties of each type.
 33892	
 33893	Speaking generally, it may be said that dry gangrene is essentially due
 33894	to a simple _interference with the blood supply_ of a part; while the
 33895	main factor in the production of moist gangrene is _bacterial
 33896	infection_.
 33897	
 33898	The cardinal signs of gangrene are: change in the colour of the part,
 33899	coldness, loss of sensation and motor power, and, lastly, loss of
 33900	pulsation in the arteries.
 33901	
 33902	#Dry Gangrene# or #Mummification# is a comparatively slow form of local
 33903	death due, as a rule, to a diminution in the arterial blood supply of
 33904	the affected part, resulting from such causes as the gradual narrowing
 33905	of the lumen of the arteries by disease of their coats, or the blocking
 33906	of the main vessel by an embolus.
 33907	
 33908	As the fluids in the tissues are lost by evaporation the part becomes
 33909	dry and shrivelled, and as the skin is usually intact, infection does
 33910	not take place, or if it does, the want of moisture renders the part an
 33911	unsuitable soil, and the organisms do not readily find a footing. Any
 33912	spread of the process that may take place is chiefly influenced by the
 33913	anatomical distribution of the blocked arteries, and is arrested as soon
 33914	as it reaches an area rich in anastomotic vessels. The dead portion is
 33915	then cast off, the irritation resulting from the contact of the dead
 33916	with the still living tissue inducing the formation of granulations on
 33917	the proximal side of the junction, and these by slowly eating into the
 33918	dead portion produce a furrow--the _line of demarcation_--which
 33919	gradually deepens until complete separation is effected. As the muscles
 33920	and bones have a richer blood supply than the integument, the death of
 33921	skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of muscles and
 33922	bone, with the result that the stump left after spontaneous separation
 33923	is conical, the end of the bone projecting beyond the soft parts.
 33924	
 33925	_Clinical Features._--The part undergoing mortification becomes colder
 33926	than normal, the temperature falling to that of the surrounding
 33927	atmosphere. In many instances, but not in all, the onset of the process
 33928	is accompanied by severe neuralgic pain in the part, probably due to
 33929	anaemia of the nerves, to neuritis, or to the irritation of the exposed
 33930	axis cylinders by the dead and dying tissues around them. This pain soon
 33931	ceases and gives place to a complete loss of sensation. The dead part
 33932	becomes dry, horny, shrivelled, and semi-transparent--at first of a dark
 33933	brown, but finally of a black colour, from the dissemination of blood
 33934	pigment throughout the tissues. There is no putrefaction, and therefore
 33935	no putrid odour; and the condition being non-infective, there is not
 33936	necessarily any constitutional disturbance. In itself, therefore, dry
 33937	gangrene does not involve immediate risk to life; the danger lies in the
 33938	fact that the breach of surface at the line of demarcation furnishes a
 33939	possible means of entrance for bacteria, which may lead to infective
 33940	complications.
 33941	
 33942	#Moist Gangrene# is an acute process, the dead part retaining its fluids
 33943	and so affording a favourable soil for the development of bacteria. The
 33944	action of the organisms and their toxins on the adjacent tissues leads
 33945	to a rapid and wide spread of the process. The skin becomes moist and
 33946	macerated, and bullae, containing dark-coloured fluid or gases, form
 33947	under the epidermis. The putrefactive gases evolved cause the skin to
 33948	become emphysematous and crepitant and produce an offensive odour. The
 33949	tissues assume a greenish-black colour from the formation in them of a
 33950	sulphide of iron resulting from decomposition of the blood pigment.
 33951	Under certain conditions the dead part may undergo changes resembling
 33952	more closely those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition. Owing to its
 33953	nature the spread of the gangrene is seldom arrested by the natural
 33954	protective processes, and it usually continues until the condition
 33955	proves fatal from the absorption of toxins into the circulation.
 33956	
 33957	The _clinical features_ vary in the different varieties of moist
 33958	gangrene, but the local results of bacterial action and the
 33959	constitutional disturbance associated with toxin absorption are present
 33960	in all; the prognosis therefore is grave in the extreme.
 33961	
 33962	From what has been said, it will be gathered that in dry gangrene there
 33963	is no urgent call for operation to save the patient's life, the primary
 33964	indication being to prevent the access of bacteria to the dead part, and
 33965	especially to the surface exposed at the line of demarcation. In moist
 33966	gangrene, on the contrary, organisms having already obtained a footing,
 33967	immediate removal of the dead and dying tissues, as a rule, offers the
 33968	only hope of saving life.
 33969	
 33970	
 33971	VARIETIES OF GANGRENE
 33972	
 33973	#Varieties of Gangrene essentially due to Interference with the
 33974	Circulation#
 33975	
 33976	While the varieties of gangrene included in this group depend primarily
 33977	on interference with the circulation, it is to be borne in mind that the
 33978	clinical course of the affection may be profoundly influenced by
 33979	superadded infection with micro-organisms. Although the bacteria do not
 33980	play the most important part in producing tissue necrosis, their
 33981	
 33982	subsequent introduction is an accident of such importance that it may
 33983	change the whole aspect of affairs and convert a dry form of gangrene
 33984	into one of the moist type. Moreover, the low state of vitality of the
 33985	tissues, and the extreme difficulty of securing and maintaining asepsis,
 33986	make it a sequel of great frequency.
 33987	
 33988	#Senile Gangrene.#--Senile gangrene is the commonest example of local
 33989	death produced by a _gradual_ diminution in the quantity of blood
 33990	passing through the parts, as a result of arterio-sclerosis or other
 33991	chronic disease of the arteries leading to diminution of their calibre.
 33992	It is the most characteristic example of the dry type of gangrene. As
 33993	the term indicates, it occurs in old persons, but the patient's age is
 33994	to be reckoned by the condition of his arteries rather than by the
 33995	number of his years. Thus the vessels of a comparatively young man who
 33996	has suffered from syphilis and been addicted to alcohol are more liable
 33997	to atheromatous degeneration leading to this form of gangrene than are
 33998	those of a much older man who has lived a regular and abstemious life.
 33999	This form of gangrene is much more common in men than in women. While it
 34000	usually attacks only one foot, it is not uncommon for the other foot to
 34001	be affected after an interval, and in some cases it is bilateral from
 34002	the outset. It must clearly be understood that any form of gangrene may
 34003	
 34004	occur in old persons, the term senile being here restricted to that
 34005	variety which results from arterio-sclerosis.
 34006	
 34007	[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Senile Gangrene of the Foot, showing line of
 34008	demarcation.]
 34009	
 34010	_Clinical Features._--The commonest seat of the disease is in the toes,
 34011	especially the great toe, whence it spreads up the foot to the heel, or
 34012	even to the leg (Fig. 20). There is often a history of some slight
 34013	injury preceding its onset. The vitality of the tissues is so low that
 34014	the balance between life and death may be turned by the most trivial
 34015	injury, such as a cut while paring a toe-nail or a corn, a blister
 34016	caused by an ill-fitting shoe or the contact of a hot-bottle. In some
 34017	cases the actual gangrene is determined by thrombosis of the popliteal
 34018	or tibial arteries, which are already narrowed by obliterating
 34019	endarteritis.
 34020	
 34021	It is common to find that the patient has been troubled for a long time
 34022	before the onset of definite signs of gangrene, with cold feet, with
 34023	tingling and loss of feeling, or a peculiar sensation as if walking on
 34024	cotton wool.
 34025	
 34026	The first evidence of the death of the part varies in different cases.
 34027	Sometimes a dark-blue spot appears on the medial side of the great toe
 34028	and gradually increases in size; or a blister containing blood-stained
 34029	fluid may form. Streaks or patches of dark-blue mottling appear higher
 34030	up on the foot or leg. In other cases a small sore surrounded by a
 34031	congested areola forms in relation to the nail and refuses to heal. Such
 34032	sores on the toes of old persons are always to be looked upon with
 34033	suspicion and treated with the greatest care; and the urine should be
 34034	examined for sugar. There is often severe, deep-seated pain of a
 34035	neuralgic character, with cramps in the limb, and these may persist long
 34036	after a line of demarcation has formed. The dying part loses sensibility
 34037	to touch and becomes cold and shrivelled.
 34038	
 34039	All the physical appearances and clinical symptoms associated with dry
 34040	gangrene supervene, and the dead portion is delimited by a line of
 34041	demarcation. If this forms slowly and irregularly it indicates a very
 34042	unsatisfactory condition of the circulation; while, if it forms quickly
 34043	and decidedly, the presumption is that the circulation in the parts
 34044	above is fairly good. The separation of the dead part is always attended
 34045	with the risk of infection taking place, and should this occur, the
 34046	temperature rises and other evidences of toxaemia appear.
 34047	
 34048	_Prophylaxis._--The toes and feet of old people, the condition of whose
 34049	circulation predisposes them to gangrene, should be protected from
 34050	slight injuries such as may be received while paring nails, cutting
 34051	corns, or wearing ill-fitting boots. The patient should also be warned
 34052	of the risk of exposure to cold, the use of hot-bottles, and of placing
 34053	the feet near a fire. Attempts have been made to improve the peripheral
 34054	circulation by establishing an anastomosis between the main artery of a
 34055	limb and its companion vein, so that arterial blood may reach the
 34056	peripheral capillaries--reversal of the circulation--but the clinical
 34057	results have proved disappointing. (See _Op. Surg._, p. 29.)
 34058	
 34059	_Treatment._--When there is evidence that gangrene has occurred, the
 34060	first indication is to prevent infection by purifying the part, and
 34061	after careful drying to wrap it in a thick layer of absorbent and
 34062	antiseptic wool, retained in place by a loosely applied bandage. A
 34063	slight degree of elevation of the limb is an advantage, but it must not
 34064	be sufficient to diminish the amount of blood entering the part.
 34065	Hot-bottles are to be used with the utmost caution. As absolute dryness
 34066	is essential, ointments or other greasy dressings are to be avoided, as
 34067	they tend to prevent evaporation from the skin. Opium should be given
 34068	freely to alleviate pain. Stimulation is to be avoided, and the patient
 34069	should be carefully dieted.
 34070	
 34071	When the gangrene is limited to the toes in old and feeble patients,
 34072	some surgeons advocate the expectant method of treatment, waiting for a
 34073	line of demarcation to form and allowing the dead part to be separated.
 34074	This takes place so slowly, however, that it necessitates the patient
 34075	being laid up for many weeks, or even months; and we agree with the
 34076	majority in advising early amputation.
 34077	
 34078	In this connection it is worthy of note that there are certain points at
 34079	which gangrene naturally tends to become arrested--namely, at the highly
 34080	vascular areas in the neighbourhood of joints. Thus gangrene of the
 34081	great toe often stops when it reaches the metatarso-phalangeal joint; or
 34082	if it trespasses this limit it may be arrested either at the
 34083	tarso-metatarsal or at the ankle joint. If these be passed, it usually
 34084	spreads up the leg to just below the knee before signs of arrestment
 34085	appear. Further, it is seen from pathological specimens that the spread
 34086	is greater on the dorsal than on the plantar aspect, and that the death
 34087	of skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of bone and
 34088	muscle.
 34089	
 34090	These facts furnish us with indications as to the seat and method of
 34091	amputation. Experience has proved that in senile gangrene of the lower
 34092	extremity the most reliable and satisfactory results are obtained by
 34093	amputating in the region of the knee, care being taken to perform the
 34094	operation so as to leave the prepatellar anastomosis intact by retaining
 34095	the patella in the anterior flap. The most satisfactory operation in
 34096	these cases is Gritti's supra-condylar amputation. Haemorrhage is easily
 34097	controlled by digital pressure, and the use of a tourniquet should be
 34098	dispensed with, as the constriction of the limb is liable to interfere
 34099	with the vitality of the flaps.
 34100	
 34101	When the tibial vessels can be felt pulsating at the ankle it may be
 34102	justifiable, if the patient urgently desires it, to amputate lower than
 34103	the knee; but there is considerable risk of gangrene recurring in the
 34104	stump and necessitating a second operation.
 34105	
 34106	That amputation for senile gangrene performed between the ankle and the
 34107	knee seldom succeeds, is explained by the fact that the vascular
 34108	obstruction is usually in the upper part of the posterior tibial artery,
 34109	and the operation is therefore performed through tissues with an
 34110	inadequate blood supply. It is not uncommon, indeed, on amputating above
 34111	the knee, to find even the popliteal artery plugged by a clot. This
 34112	should be removed at the amputation by squeezing the vessel from above
 34113	downward by a "milking" movement, or by "catheterising the artery" with
 34114	the aid of a cannula with a terminal aperture.
 34115	
 34116	It is to be borne in mind that the object of amputation in these cases
 34117	is merely to remove the gangrenous part, and so relieve the patient of
 34118	the discomfort and the risks from infection which its presence involves.
 34119	While it is true that in many of these patients the operation is borne
 34120	remarkably well, it must be borne in mind that those who suffer from
 34121	senile gangrene are of necessity bad lives, and a guarded opinion should
 34122	be expressed as to the prospects of survival. The possibility of the
 34123	disease developing in the other limb has already been referred to.
 34124	
 34125	[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Embolic Gangrene of Hand and Arm.]
 34126	
 34127	#Embolic Gangrene# (Fig. 21).--This is the most typical form of gangrene
 34128	resulting from the _sudden_ occlusion of the main artery of a part,
 34129	whether by the impaction of an embolus or the formation of a thrombus in
 34130	its lumen, when the collateral circulation is not sufficiently free to
 34131	maintain the vitality of the tissues.
 34132	
 34133	There is sudden pain at the site of impaction of the embolus, and the
 34134	pulses beyond are lost. The limb becomes cold, numb, insensitive, and
 34135	powerless. It is often pale at first--hence the term "white gangrene"
 34136	sometimes applicable to the early appearances, which closely resemble
 34137	those presented by the limb of a corpse.
 34138	
 34139	If the part is aseptic it shrivels, and presents the ordinary features
 34140	of dry gangrene. It is liable, however, especially in the lower
 34141	extremity and when the veins also are obstructed, to become infected and
 34142	to assume the characters of the moist type.
 34143	
 34144	The extent of the gangrene depends upon the site of impaction of the
 34145	embolus, thus if the _abdominal aorta_ becomes suddenly occluded by an
 34146	embolus at its bifurcation, the obstruction of the iliacs and femorals
 34147	induces symmetrical gangrene of both extremities as high as the inguinal
 34148	ligaments. When gangrene follows occlusion of the _external iliac_ or of
 34149	the _femoral artery_ above the origin of its deep branch, the death of
 34150	the limb extends as high as the middle or upper third of the thigh. When
 34151	the _femoral_ below the origin of its deep branch or the _popliteal
 34152	artery_ is obstructed, the veins remaining pervious, the anastomosis
 34153	through the profunda is sufficient to maintain the vascular supply, and
 34154	gangrene does not necessarily follow. The rupture of a popliteal
 34155	aneurysm, however, by compressing the vein and the articular branches,
 34156	usually determines gangrene. When an embolus becomes impacted at the
 34157	_bifurcation of the popliteal_, if gangrene ensues it usually spreads
 34158	well up the leg.
 34159	
 34160	When the _axillary artery_ is the seat of embolic impaction, and
 34161	gangrene ensues, the process usually reaches the middle of the upper
 34162	arm. Gangrene following the blocking of the _brachial_ at its
 34163	bifurcation usually extends as far as the junction of the lower and
 34164	middle thirds of the forearm.
 34165	
 34166	Gangrene due to thrombosis or embolism is sometimes met with in patients
 34167	recovering from typhus, typhoid, or other fevers, such as that
 34168	associated with child-bed. It occurs in peripheral parts, such as the
 34169	toes, fingers, nose, or ears.
 34170	
 34171	_Treatment._--The general treatment of embolic gangrene is the same as
 34172	that for the senile form. Success has followed opening the artery and
 34173	removing the embolus. The artery is exposed at the seat of impaction
 34174	and, having been clamped above and below, a longitudinal opening is made
 34175	and the clot carefully extracted with the aid of forceps; it is
 34176	sometimes unexpectedly long (one recorded from the femoral artery
 34177	measured nearly 34 inches); the wound in the artery is then sewn up with
 34178	fine silk soaked in paraffin. When amputation is indicated, it must be
 34179	performed sufficiently high to ensure a free vascular supply to the
 34180	flaps.
 34181	
 34182	#Gangrene following Ligation of Arteries.#--After the ligation of an
 34183	artery in its continuity--for example, in the treatment of aneurysm--the
 34184	limb may for some days remain in a condition verging on gangrene, the
 34185	distal parts being cold, devoid of sensation, and powerless. As the
 34186	collateral circulation is established, the vitality of the tissues is
 34187	gradually restored and these symptoms pass off. In some cases,
 34188	however,--and especially in the lower extremity--gangrene ensues and
 34189	presents the same characters as those resulting from embolism. It tends
 34190	to be of the dry type. The occlusion of the vein as well as the artery
 34191	is not found to increase the risk of gangrene.
 34192	
 34193	#Gangrene from Mechanical Constriction of the Vessels of the part.#--The
 34194	application of a bandage or plaster-of-Paris case too tightly, or of a
 34195	tourniquet for too long a time, has been known to lead to death of the
 34196	part beyond; but such cases are rare, as are also those due to the
 34197	pressure of a fractured bone or of a tumour on a large artery or vein.
 34198	When gangrene occurs from such causes, it tends to be of the moist type.
 34199	
 34200	Much commoner is it to meet with localised areas of necrosis due to the
 34201	excessive _pressure of splints_ over bony prominences, such as the
 34202	lateral malleolus, the medial condyle of the humerus, or femur, or over
 34203	the dorsum of the foot. This is especially liable to occur when the
 34204	nutrition of the skin is depressed by any interference with its
 34205	nerve-supply, such as follows injuries to the spine or peripheral
 34206	nerves, disease of the brain, or acute anterior poliomyelitis. When the
 34207	splint is removed the skin pressed upon is found to be of a pale yellow
 34208	or grey colour, and is surrounded by a ring of hyperaemia. If protected
 34209	from infection, the clinical course is that of dry gangrene.
 34210	
 34211	Bed-sores, which are closely allied to pressure sores, will be described
 34212	at the end of this chapter.
 34213	
 34214	When a localised portion of tissue, for example, a piece of skin, is so
 34215	severely _crushed_ or _bruised_ that its blood vessels are occluded and
 34216	its structure destroyed, it dies, and, if not infected with bacteria,
 34217	dries up, and the shrivelled brown skin is slowly separated by the
 34218	growth of granulation tissue beneath and around it.
 34219	
 34220	Fingers, toes, or even considerable portions of limbs may in the same
 34221	way be suddenly destroyed by severe trauma, and undergo mummification.
 34222	If organisms gain access, typical moist gangrene may ensue, or changes
 34223	similar to those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition may take place.
 34224	
 34225	_Treatment._--The first indication is to exclude bacteria by purifying
 34226	the damaged part and its surroundings, and applying dry, non-irritating
 34227	dressings.
 34228	
 34229	When these measures are successful, dry gangrene ensues. The raw surface
 34230	left after the separation of the dead skin may be allowed to heal by
 34231	granulation, or may be covered by skin-grafts. In the case of a finger
 34232	or a limb it is not necessary to wait until spontaneous separation takes
 34233	place, as this is often a slow process. When a well-marked line of
 34234	demarcation has formed, amputation may be performed just sufficiently
 34235	far above it to enable suitable flaps to be made.
 34236	
 34237	The end of a stump, after spontaneous separation of the gangrenous
 34238	portion, requires to be trimmed, sufficient bone being removed to permit
 34239	of the soft parts coming together.
 34240	
 34241	If moist gangrene supervenes, amputation must be performed without
 34242	delay, and at a higher level.
 34243	
 34244	#Gangrene from Heat, Chemical Agents, and Cold.#--Severe #burns# and
 34245	#scalds# may be followed by necrosis of tissue. So long as the parts are
 34246	kept absolutely dry--as, for example, by the picric acid method of
 34247	treatment--the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene;
 34248	but when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access,
 34249	moist gangrene follows.
 34250	
 34251	Strong #chemical agents#, such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric
 34252	acid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of
 34253	the lesions produced being like those of severe burns. The resulting
 34254	sloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which
 34255	are long of healing.
 34256	
 34257	#Carbolic Gangrene.#--Carbolic acid, even in comparatively weak
 34258	solution, is liable to induce dry gangrene when applied as a fomentation
 34259	to a finger, especially in women and children. Thrombosis occurs in the
 34260	blood vessels of the part, which at first is pale and soft, but later
 34261	becomes dark and leathery. On account of the anaesthetic action of
 34262	carbolic acid, the onset of the process is painless, and the patient
 34263	does not realise his danger. A line of demarcation soon forms, but the
 34264	dead part separates very slowly.
 34265	
 34266	#Gangrene from Frost-bite.#--It is difficult to draw the line between
 34267	the third degree of chilblain and the milder forms of true frost-bite;
 34268	the difference is merely one of degree. Frost-bite affects chiefly the
 34269	toes and fingers--especially the great toe and the little finger--the
 34270	ears, and the nose. In this country it is seldom seen except in members
 34271	of the tramp class, who, in addition to being exposed to cold by
 34272	sleeping in the open air, are ill-fed and generally debilitated. The
 34273	condition usually manifests itself after the parts, having been
 34274	subjected to extreme cold, are brought into warm surroundings. The first
 34275	symptom is numbness in the part, followed by a sense of weight,
 34276	tingling, and finally by complete loss of sensation. The part attacked
 34277	becomes white and bleached-looking, feels icy cold, and is insensitive
 34278	to touch. Either immediately, or, it may be, not for several days, it
 34279	becomes discoloured and swollen, and finally contracts and shrivels.
 34280	Above the dead area the limb may be the seat of excruciating pain. The
 34281	dead portion is cast off, as in other forms of dry gangrene, by the
 34282	formation of a line of demarcation.
 34283	
 34284	To prevent the occurrence of gangrene from frost-bite it is necessary to
 34285	avoid the sudden application of heat. The patient should be placed in a
 34286	cold room, and the part rubbed with snow, or put in a cold bath, and
 34287	have light friction applied to it. As the circulation is restored the
 34288	general surroundings and the local applications are gradually made
 34289	warmer. Elevation of the part, wrapping it in cotton wool, and removal
 34290	to a warmer room, are then permissible, and stimulants and warm drinks
 34291	may be given with caution. When by these means the occurrence of
 34292	gangrene is averted, recovery ensues, its onset being indicated by the
 34293	white parts assuming a livid red hue and becoming the seat of an acute
 34294	burning sensation.
 34295	
 34296	A condition known as _Trench feet_ was widely prevalent amongst the
 34297	troops in France during the European War. Although allied to frost-bite,
 34298	cold appears to play a less important part in its causation than
 34299	humidity and constriction of the limbs producing ischaemia of the feet.
 34300	Changes were found in the endothelium of the blood vessels, the axis
 34301	cylinders of nerves, and the muscles. The condition does not occur in
 34302	civil life.
 34303	
 34304	#Diabetic Gangrene.#--This form of gangrene is prone to occur in persons
 34305	over fifty years of age who suffer from glycosuria. The arteries are
 34306	often markedly diseased. In some cases the existence of the glycosuria
 34307	is unsuspected before the onset of the gangrene, and it is only on
 34308	examining the urine that the cause of the condition is discovered. The
 34309	gangrenous process seldom begins as suddenly as that associated with
 34310	embolism, and, like senile gangrene, which it may closely simulate in
 34311	its early stages, it not infrequently begins after a slight injury to
 34312	one of the toes. It but rarely, however, assumes the dry, shrivelling
 34313	type, as a rule being attended with swelling, oedema, and dusky redness
 34314	of the foot, and severe pain. According to Paget, the dead part remains
 34315	warm longer than in other forms of senile gangrene; there is a greater
 34316	tendency for patches of skin at some distance from the primary seat of
 34317	disease to become gangrenous, and for the death of tissue to extend
 34318	upwards in the subcutaneous planes, leaving the overlying skin
 34319	unaffected. The low vitality of the tissues favours the growth of
 34320	bacteria, and if these gain access, the gangrene assumes the characters
 34321	of the moist type and spreads rapidly.
 34322	
 34323	The rules for amputation are the same as those governing the treatment
 34324	of senile gangrene, the level at which the limb is removed depending
 34325	upon whether the gangrene is of the dry or moist type. The general
 34326	treatment for diabetes must, of course, be employed whether amputation
 34327	is performed or not. Paget recommended that the dietetic treatment
 34328	should not be so rigid as in uncomplicated diabetes, and that opium
 34329	should be given freely.
 34330	
 34331	The _prognosis_ even after amputation is unfavourable. In many cases the
 34332	patient dies with symptoms of diabetic coma within a few days of the
 34333	operation; or, if he survives this, he may eventually succumb to
 34334	diabetes. In others there is sloughing of the flaps and death results
 34335	from toxaemia. Occasionally the other limb becomes gangrenous. On the
 34336	other hand, the glycosuria may diminish or may even disappear after
 34337	amputation.
 34338	
 34339	#Gangrene associated with Spasm of Blood Vessels.#--#Raynaud's Disease#,
 34340	or symmetrical gangrene, is supposed to be due to spasm of the
 34341	arterioles, resulting from peripheral neuritis. It occurs oftenest in
 34342	women, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, who are the subjects of
 34343	uterine disorders, anaemia, or chlorosis. Cold is an aggravating factor,
 34344	as the disease is commonest during the winter months. The digits of both
 34345	hands or the toes of both feet are simultaneously attacked, and the
 34346	disease seldom spreads beyond the phalanges or deeper than the skin.
 34347	
 34348	The first evidence is that the fingers become cold, white, and
 34349	insensitive to touch and pain. These attacks of _local syncope_ recur at
 34350	varying intervals for months or even years. They last for a few minutes
 34351	or even for some hours, and as they pass off the parts become hyperaemic
 34352	and painful.
 34353	
 34354	A more advanced stage of the disease is known as _local asphyxia_. The
 34355	circulation through the fingers becomes exceedingly sluggish, and the
 34356	parts assume a dull, livid hue. There is swelling and burning or
 34357	shooting pain. This may pass off in a few days, or may increase in
 34358	severity, with the formation of bullae, and end in dry gangrene. As a
 34359	rule, the slough which forms is comparatively small and superficial,
 34360	but it may take some months to separate. The condition tends to recur in
 34361	successive winters.
 34362	
 34363	The _treatment_ consists in remedying any nervous or uterine disorder
 34364	that may be present, keeping the parts warm by wrapping them in cotton
 34365	wool, and in the use of hot-air or electric baths, the parts being
 34366	immersed in water through which a constant current is passed. When
 34367	gangrene occurs, it is treated on the same lines as other forms of dry
 34368	gangrene, but if amputation is called for it is only with a view to
 34369	removing the dead part.
 34370	
 34371	#Angio-sclerotic Gangrene.#--A form of gangrene due to _angio-sclerosis_
 34372	is occasionally met with in young persons, even in children. It bears
 34373	certain analogies to Raynaud's disease in that spasm of the vessels
 34374	plays a part in determining the local death.
 34375	
 34376	The main arteries are narrowed by hyperplastic endarteritis followed by
 34377	thrombosis, and similar changes are found in the veins. The condition is
 34378	usually met with in the feet, but the upper extremity may be affected,
 34379	and is attended with very severe pain, rendering sleep impossible.
 34380	
 34381	The patient is liable to sudden attacks of numbness, tingling and
 34382	weakness of the limbs which pass off with rest--_intermittent
 34383	claudication_. During these attacks the large arteries--femoral,
 34384	brachial, and subclavian--can be felt as firm cords, while pulsation is
 34385	lost in the peripheral vessels. Gangrene eventually ensues, is attended
 34386	with great pain and runs a slow course. It is treated on the same lines
 34387	as Raynaud's disease.
 34388	
 34389	#Gangrene from Ergot.#--Gangrene may occur from interference with blood
 34390	supply, the result of tetanic contraction of the minute vessels, such as
 34391	results in ill-nourished persons who eat large quantities of coarse rye
 34392	bread contaminated with the _claviceps purpurea_ and containing the
 34393	ergot of rye. It has also occurred in the fingers of patients who have
 34394	taken ergot medicinally over long periods. The gangrene, which attacks
 34395	the toes, fingers, ears, or nose, is preceded by formication, numbness,
 34396	and pains in the parts to be affected, and is of the dry variety.
 34397	
 34398	In this country it is usually met with in sailors off foreign ships,
 34399	whose dietary largely consists of rye bread. Trivial injuries may be the
 34400	starting-point, the anaesthesia produced by the ergotin preventing the
 34401	patient taking notice of them. Alcoholism is a potent predisposing
 34402	cause.
 34403	
 34404	As it is impossible to predict how far the process will spread, it is
 34405	advisable to wait for the formation of a line of demarcation before
 34406	operating, and then to amputate immediately above the dead part.
 34407	
 34408	
 34409	BACTERIAL VARIETIES OF GANGRENE
 34410	
 34411	The acute bacillary forms of gangrene all assume the moist type from the
 34412	first, and, spreading rapidly, result in extensive necrosis of tissue,
 34413	and often end fatally.
 34414	
 34415	The infection is usually a mixed one in which anaerobic bacteria
 34416	predominate. The anaerobe most constantly present is the _bacillus
 34417	aerogenes capsulatus_, usually in association with other anaerobes, and
 34418	sometimes with pyogenic diplo- and streptococci. According to the mode of
 34419	action of the associated organisms and the combined effects of their
 34420	toxins on the tissues, the gangrenous process presents different
 34421	pathological and clinical features. Some combinations, for example,
 34422	result in a rapidly spreading cellulitis with early necrosis of
 34423	connective tissue accompanied by thrombosis throughout the capillary and
 34424	venous circulation of the parts implicated; other combinations cause
 34425	great oedema of the part, and others again lead to the formation of gases
 34426	in the tissues, particularly in the muscles.
 34427	
 34428	These different effects do not appear to be due to a specific action of
 34429	any one of the organisms present, but to the combined effect of a
 34430	particular group living in symbiosis.
 34431	
 34432	According as the cellulitic, the oedematous, or the gaseous
 34433	characteristics predominate, the clinical varieties of bacillary
 34434	gangrene may be separately described, but it must be clearly understood
 34435	that they frequently overlap and cannot always be distinguished from one
 34436	another.
 34437	
 34438	#Clinical Varieties of Bacillary Gangrene.#--#Acute infective gangrene#
 34439	is the form most commonly met with in civil practice. It may follow such
 34440	trivial injuries as a pin-prick or a scratch, the signs of acute
 34441	cellulitis rapidly giving place to those of a spreading gangrene. Or it
 34442	may ensue on a severe railway, machinery, or street accident, when
 34443	lacerated and bruised tissues are contaminated with gross dirt. Often
 34444	within a few hours of the injury the whole part rapidly becomes painful,
 34445	swollen, oedematous, and tense. The skin is at first glazed, and perhaps
 34446	paler than normal, but soon assumes a dull red or purplish hue, and
 34447	bullae form on the surface. Putrefactive gases may be evolved in the
 34448	tissues, and their presence is indicated by emphysematous crackling when
 34449	the part is handled. The spread of the disease is so rapid that its
 34450	progress is quite visible from hour to hour, and may be traced by the
 34451	occurrence of red lines along the course of the lymphatics of the limb.
 34452	In the most acute cases the death of the affected part takes place so
 34453	rapidly that the local changes indicative of gangrene have not time to
 34454	occur, and the fact that the part is dead may be overlooked.
 34455	
 34456	[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Gangrene of Terminal Phalanx of Index-Finger,
 34457	following cellulitis of hand resulting from a scratch on the palm of the
 34458	hand.]
 34459	
 34460	Rigors may occur, but the temperature is not necessarily raised--indeed,
 34461	it is sometimes subnormal. The pulse is small, feeble, rapid, and
 34462	irregular. Unless amputation is promptly performed, death usually
 34463	follows within thirty-six or forty-eight hours. Even early operation
 34464	does not always avert the fatal issue, because the quantity of toxin
 34465	absorbed and its extreme virulence are often more than even a robust
 34466	subject can outlive.
 34467	
 34468	_Treatment._--Every effort must be made to purify all such wounds as are
 34469	contaminated by earth, street dust, stable refuse, or other forms of
 34470	gross dirt. Devitalised and contaminated tissue is removed with the
 34471	knife or scissors and the wound purified with antiseptics of the
 34472	chlorine group or with hydrogen peroxide. If there is a reasonable
 34473	prospect that infection has been overcome, the wound may be at once
 34474	sutured, but if this is doubtful it is left open and packed or
 34475	irrigated.
 34476	
 34477	When acute gangrene has set in no treatment short of amputation is of
 34478	any avail, and the sooner this is done, the greater is the hope of
 34479	saving the patient. The limb must be amputated well beyond the apparent
 34480	limits of the infected area, and stringent precautions must be taken to
 34481	avoid discharge from the already gangrenous area reaching the operation
 34482	wound. An assistant or nurse, who is to take no other part in the
 34483	operation, is told off to carry out the preliminary purification, and to
 34484	hold the limb during the operation.
 34485	
 34486	#Malignant Oedema.#--This form of acute gangrene has been defined as
 34487	"a spreading inflammatory oedema attended with emphysema, and ultimately
 34488	followed by gangrene of the skin and adjacent parts." The predominant
 34489	organism is the _bacillus of malignant oedema_ or _vibrion septique_ of
 34490	Pasteur, which is found in garden soil, dung, and various putrefying
 34491	substances. It is anaerobic, and occurs as long, thick rods with
 34492	somewhat rounded ends and several laterally placed flagella. Spores,
 34493	which have a high power of resistance, form in the centre of the rods,
 34494	and bulge out the sides so as to give the organisms a spindle-shaped
 34495	outline. Other pathogenic organisms are also present and aid the
 34496	specific bacillus in its action.
 34497	
 34498	At the bedside it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish it
 34499	from acute infective gangrene. Both follow on the same kinds of injury
 34500	and run an exceedingly rapid course. In malignant oedema, however, the
 34501	incidence of the disease is mainly on the superficial parts, which
 34502	become oedematous and emphysematous, and acquire a marbled appearance
 34503	with the veins clearly outlined. Early disappearance of sensation is a
 34504	particularly grave symptom. Bullae form on the skin, and the tissues
 34505	have "a peculiar heavy but not putrid odour." The constitutional effects
 34506	are extremely severe, and death may ensue within a few hours.
 34507	
 34508	#Acute Emphysematous# or #Gas Gangrene# was prevalent in certain areas
 34509	at various periods during the European War. It follows infection of
 34510	lacerated wounds with the _bacillus aerogenes capsulatus_, usually in
 34511	combination with other anaerobes, and its main incidence is on the
 34512	muscles, which rapidly become infiltrated with gas that spreads
 34513	throughout the whole extent of the muscle, disintegrating its fibres and
 34514	leading to necrosis. The gangrenous process spreads with appalling
 34515	rapidity, the limb becoming enormously swollen, painful, and crepitant
 34516	or even tympanitic. Patches of coppery or purple colour appear on the
 34517	skin, and bullae containing blood-stained serum form on the surface. The
 34518	toxaemia is profound, and the face and lips assume a characteristic
 34519	cyanosis. The condition is attended with a high mortality. Only in the
 34520	early stages and when the infection is limited are local measures
 34521	successful in arresting the spread; in more severe cases amputation is
 34522	the only means of saving life.
 34523	
 34524	#Cancrum Oris# or #Noma#.--This disease is believed to be due to a
 34525	specific bacillus, which occurs in long delicate rods, and is chiefly
 34526	found at the margin of the gangrenous area. It is prone to attack
 34527	unhealthy children from two to five years of age, especially during
 34528	their convalescence from such diseases as measles, scarlet fever, or
 34529	typhoid, but may attack adults when they are debilitated. It is most
 34530	common in the mouth, but sometimes occurs on the vulva. In the mouth it
 34531	begins as an ulcerative stomatitis, more especially affecting the gums
 34532	or inner aspect of the cheek. The child lies prostrated, and from the
 34533	open mouth foul-smelling saliva, streaked with blood, escapes; the face
 34534	is of an ashy-grey colour, the lips dark and swollen. On the inner
 34535	aspect of the cheek is a deeply ulcerated surface, with sloughy shreds
 34536	of dark-brown or black tissue covering its base; the edges are
 34537	irregular, firm, and swollen, and the surrounding mucous membrane is
 34538	infiltrated and oedematous. In the course of a few hours a dark spot
 34539	appears on the outer aspect of the cheek, and rapidly increases in size;
 34540	towards the centre it is black, shading off through blue and grey into a
 34541	dark-red area which extends over the cheek (Fig. 23). The tissue
 34542	implicated is at first firm and indurated, but as it loses its vitality
 34543	it becomes doughy and sodden. Finally a slough forms, and, when it
 34544	separates, the cheek is perforated.
 34545	
 34546	Meanwhile the process spreads inside the mouth, and the gums, the floor
 34547	of the mouth, or even the jaws, may become gangrenous and the teeth fall
 34548	out. The constitutional disturbance is severe, the temperature raised,
 34549	and the pulse feeble and rapid.
 34550	
 34551	The extremely foetid odour which pervades the room or even the house the
 34552	patient occupies, is usually sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of
 34553	cancrum oris. The odour must not be mistaken for that due to
 34554	decomposition of sordes on the teeth and gums of a debilitated patient.
 34555	
 34556	The _prognosis_ is always grave in the extreme, the main risks being
 34557	general toxaemia and septic pneumonia. When recovery takes place there is
 34558	serious deformity, and considerable portions of the jaws may be lost by
 34559	necrosis.
 34560	
 34561	[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Cancrum oris.
 34562	
 34563	(From a photograph lent by Sir George T. Beatson.)]
 34564	
 34565	_Treatment._--The only satisfactory treatment is thorough removal under
 34566	an anaesthetic of all the sloughy tissue, with the surrounding zone in
 34567	which the organisms are active. This is most efficiently accomplished by
 34568	the knife or scissors, cutting until the tissue bleeds freely, after
 34569	which the raw surface is painted with undiluted carbolic acid and
 34570	dressed with iodoform gauze. It may be necessary to remove large pieces
 34571	of bone when the necrotic process has implicated the jaws. The mouth
 34572	must be constantly sprayed with peroxide of hydrogen, and washed out
 34573	with a disinfectant and deodorant lotion, such as Condy's fluid. The
 34574	patient's general condition calls for free stimulation.
 34575	
 34576	The deformity resulting from these necessarily heroic measures is not so
 34577	great as might be expected, and can be further diminished by plastic
 34578	operations, which should be undertaken before cicatricial contraction
 34579	has occurred.
 34580	
 34581	
 34582	BED-SORES
 34583	
 34584	Bed-sores are most frequently met with in old and debilitated patients,
 34585	or in those whose tissues are devitalised by acute or chronic diseases
 34586	associated with stagnation of blood in the peripheral veins. Any
 34587	interference with the nerve-supply of the skin, whether from injury or
 34588	disease of the central nervous system or of the peripheral nerves,
 34589	strongly predisposes to the formation of bed-sores. Prolonged and
 34590	excessive pressure over a bony prominence, especially if the parts be
 34591	moist with skin secretions, urine, or wound discharges, determines the
 34592	formation of a sore. Excoriations, which may develop into true
 34593	bed-sores, sometimes form where two skin surfaces remain constantly
 34594	apposed, as in the region of the scrotum or labium, under pendulous
 34595	mammae, or between fingers or toes confined in a splint.
 34596	
 34597	[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Acute Bed-Sores over Right Buttock.]
 34598	
 34599	_Clinical Features._--Two clinical varieties are met with--the acute
 34600	and the chronic bed-sore.
 34601	
 34602	The _acute_ bed-sore usually occurs over the sacrum or buttock. It
 34603	develops rapidly after spinal injuries and in the course of certain
 34604	brain diseases. The part affected becomes red and congested, while the
 34605	surrounding parts are oedematous and swollen, blisters form, and the skin
 34606	loses its vitality (Fig. 24).
 34607	
 34608	In advanced cases of general paralysis of the insane, a peculiar form of
 34609	acute bed-sore beginning as a blister, and passing on to the formation
 34610	of a black, dry eschar, which slowly separates, occurs on such parts as
 34611	the medial side of the knee, the angle of the scapula, and the heel.
 34612	
 34613	The _chronic_ bed-sore begins as a dusky reddish purple patch, which
 34614	gradually becomes darker till it is almost black. The parts around are
 34615	oedematous, and a blister may form. This bursts and exposes the papillae
 34616	of the skin, which are of a greenish hue. A tough greyish-black slough
 34617	forms, and is slowly separated. It is not uncommon for the gangrenous
 34618	area to continue to spread both in width and in depth till it reaches
 34619	the periosteum or bone. Bed-sores over the sacrum sometimes implicate
 34620	the vertebral canal and lead to spinal meningitis, which usually proves
 34621	fatal.
 34622	
 34623	In old and debilitated patients the septic absorption taking place from
 34624	a bed-sore often proves a serious complication of other surgical
 34625	conditions. From this cause, for example, old people may succumb during
 34626	the treatment of a fractured thigh.
 34627	
 34628	The granulating surface left on the separation of the slough tends to
 34629	heal comparatively rapidly.
 34630	
 34631	_Prevention of Bed-sores._--The first essential in the prevention of
 34632	bed-sores is the regular changing of the patient's position, so that no
 34633	one part of the body is continuously pressed upon for any length of
 34634	time. Ring-pads of wool, air-cushions, or water-beds are necessary to
 34635	remove pressure from prominent parts. Absolute dryness of the skin is
 34636	all-important. At least once a day, the sacrum, buttocks,
 34637	shoulder-blades, heels, elbows, malleoli, or other parts exposed to
 34638	pressure, must be sponged with soap and water, thoroughly dried, and
 34639	then rubbed with methylated spirit, which is allowed to dry on the skin.
 34640	Dusting the part with boracic acid powder not only keeps it dry, but
 34641	prevents the development of bacteria in the skin secretions.
 34642	
 34643	In operation cases, care must be taken that irritating chemicals used to
 34644	purify the skin do not collect under the patient and remain in contact
 34645	with the skin of the sacrum and buttocks during the time he is on the
 34646	operating-table. There is reason to believe that the so-called
 34647	"post-operation bed-sore" may be due to such causes. A similar result
 34648	has been known to follow soiling of the sheets by the escape of a
 34649	turpentine enema.
 34650	
 34651	_Treatment._--Once a bed-sore has formed, every effort must be made to
 34652	prevent its spread. Alcohol is used to cleanse the broken surface, and
 34653	dry absorbent dressings are applied and frequently changed. It is
 34654	sometimes found necessary to employ moist or oily substances, such as
 34655	boracic poultices, eucalyptus ointment, or balsam of Peru, to facilitate
 34656	the separation of sloughs, or to promote the growth of granulations. In
 34657	patients who are not extremely debilitated the slough may be excised,
 34658	the raw surface scraped, and then painted with iodine.
 34659	
 34660	Skin-grafting is sometimes useful in covering in the large raw surface
 34661	left after separation or removal of sloughs.

 34675	
 34676	ERYSIPELAS
 34677	
 34678	Erysipelas, popularly known as "rose," is an acute spreading infective
 34679	disease of the skin or of a mucous membrane due to the action of a
 34680	streptococcus. Infection invariably takes place through an abrasion of
 34681	the surface, although this may be so slight that it escapes observation
 34682	even when sought for. The streptococci are found most abundantly in the
 34683	lymph spaces just beyond the swollen margin of the inflammatory area,
 34684	and in the serous blebs which sometimes form on the surface.
 34685	
 34686	#Clinical Features.#--_Facial erysipelas_ is the commonest clinical
 34687	variety, infection usually occurring through some slight abrasion in the
 34688	region of the mouth or nose, or from an operation wound in this area.
 34689	From this point of origin the inflammation may spread all over the face
 34690	and scalp as far back as the nape of the neck. It stops, however, at the
 34691	chin, and never extends on to the front of the neck. There is great
 34692	oedema of the face, the eyes becoming closed up, and the features
 34693	unrecognisable. The inflammation may spread to the meninges, the
 34694	intracranial venous sinuses, the eye, or the ear. In some cases the
 34695	erysipelas invades the mucous membrane of the mouth, and spreads to the
 34696	fauces and larynx, setting up an oedema of the glottis which may prove
 34697	dangerous to life.
 34698	
 34699	Erysipelas occasionally attacks an operation wound that has become
 34700	septic; and it may accompany septic infection of the genital tract in
 34701	puerperal women, or the separation of the umbilical cord in infants
 34702	(_erysipelas neonatorum_). After an incubation period, which varies from
 34703	fifteen to sixty hours, the patient complains of headache, pains in the
 34704	back and limbs, loss of appetite, nausea, and frequently there is
 34705	vomiting. He has a chill or slight rigor, initiating a rise of
 34706	temperature to 103 o, 104 o, or 105 o F.; and a full bounding pulse of
 34707	about 100 (Fig. 25). The tongue is foul, the breath heavy, and, as a
 34708	rule, the bowels are constipated. There is frequently albuminuria, and
 34709	occasionally nocturnal delirium. A moderate degree of leucocytosis
 34710	(15,000 to 20,000) is usually present.
 34711	
 34712	Around the seat of inoculation a diffuse red patch forms, varying in hue
 34713	from a bright scarlet to a dull brick-red. The edges are slightly raised
 34714	above the level of the surrounding skin, as may readily be recognised by
 34715	gently stroking the part from the healthy towards the affected area. The
 34716	skin is smooth, tense, and glossy, and presents here and there blisters
 34717	filled with serous fluid. The local temperature is raised, and the part
 34718	is the seat of a burning sensation and is tender to the touch, the most
 34719	tender area being the actively spreading zone which lies about half an
 34720	inch beyond the red margin.
 34721	
 34722	[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Chart of Erysipelas occurring in a wound.]
 34723	
 34724	The disease tends to spread spasmodically and irregularly, and the
 34725	direction and extent of its progress may be recognised by mapping out
 34726	the peripheral zone of tenderness. Red streaks appear along the lines of
 34727	the superficial lymph vessels, and the deep lymphatics may sometimes be
 34728	palpated as firm, tender cords. The neighbouring glands, also, are
 34729	generally enlarged and tender.
 34730	
 34731	The disease lasts for from two or three days to as many weeks, and
 34732	relapses are frequent. Spontaneous resolution usually takes place, but
 34733	the disease may prove fatal from absorption of toxins, involvement of
 34734	the brain or meninges, or from general streptococcal infection.
 34735	
 34736	#Complications.#--_Diffuse suppurative cellulitis_ is the most serious
 34737	local complication, and results from a mixed infection with other
 34738	pyogenic bacteria. Small _localised superficial abscesses_ may form
 34739	during the convalescent stage. They are doubtless due to the action of
 34740	skin bacteria, which attack the tissues devitalised by the erysipelas. A
 34741	persistent form of _oedema_ sometimes remains after recurrent attacks of
 34742	erysipelas, especially when they affect the face or the lower extremity,
 34743	a condition which is referred to with elephantiasis.
 34744	
 34745	#Treatment.#--The first indication is to endeavour to arrest the spread
 34746	of the process. We have found that by painting with linimentum iodi, a
 34747	ring half an inch broad, about an inch in front of the peripheral tender
 34748	zone--not the red margin--an artificial leucocytosis is produced, and
 34749	the advancing streptococci are thereby arrested. Several coats of the
 34750	iodine are applied, one after the other, and this is repeated daily for
 34751	several days, even although the erysipelas has not overstepped the ring.
 34752	Success depends upon using the liniment of iodine (the tincture is not
 34753	strong enough), and in applying it well in front of the disease. To
 34754	allay pain the most useful local applications are ichthyol ointment (1
 34755	in 6), or lead and opium fomentations.
 34756	
 34757	The general treatment consists in attending to the emunctories, in
 34758	administrating quinine in small--two-grain--doses every four hours, or
 34759	salicylate of iron (2-5 gr. every three hours), and in giving plenty of
 34760	fluid nourishment. It is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic
 34761	serum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might
 34762	have been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the
 34763	proper strain of streptococcus.
 34764	
 34765	It is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual
 34766	precautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are
 34767	rigidly carried out.
 34768	
 34769	
 34770	DIPHTHERIA
 34771	
 34772	Diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific
 34773	bacterium, the _bacillus diphtheriae_ or _Klebs-Loffler bacillus_. The
 34774	disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may
 34775	be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.
 34776	Cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from
 34777	one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions. The
 34778	incubation period varies from two to seven days.
 34779	
 34780	#Clinical Features.#--In _pharyngeal diphtheria_, on the first or
 34781	second day of the disease, redness and swelling of the mucous membrane
 34782	of the pharynx, tonsils, and palate are well marked, and small, circular
 34783	greenish or grey patches of false membrane, composed of necrosed
 34784	epithelium, fibrin, leucocytes, and red blood corpuscles, begin to
 34785	appear. These rapidly increase in area and thickness, till they coalesce
 34786	and form a complete covering to the parts. In the pharynx the false
 34787	membrane is less adherent to the surface than it is when the disease
 34788	affects the air-passages. The diphtheritic process may spread from the
 34789	pharynx to the nasal cavities, causing blocking of the nares, with a
 34790	profuse ichorous discharge from the nostrils, and sometimes severe
 34791	epistaxis. The infection may spread along the nasal duct to the
 34792	conjunctiva. The middle ear also may become involved by spread along the
 34793	auditory (Eustachian) tube.
 34794	
 34795	The lymph glands behind the angle of the jaw enlarge and become tender,
 34796	and may suppurate from superadded infection. There is pain on
 34797	swallowing, and often earache; and the patient speaks with a nasal
 34798	accent. He becomes weak and anaemic, and loses his appetite. There is
 34799	often albuminuria. Leucocytosis is usually well marked before the
 34800	injection of antitoxin; after the injection there is usually a
 34801	diminution in the number of leucocytes. The false membrane may separate
 34802	and be cast off, after which the patient gradually recovers. Death may
 34803	take place from gradual failure of the heart's action or from syncope
 34804	during some slight exertion.
 34805	
 34806	_Laryngeal Diphtheria._--The disease may arise in the larynx, although,
 34807	as a rule, it spreads thence from the pharynx. It first manifests itself
 34808	by a short, dry, croupy cough, and hoarseness of the voice. The first
 34809	difficulty in breathing usually takes place during the night, and once
 34810	it begins, it rapidly gets worse. Inspiration becomes noisy, sometimes
 34811	stridulous or metallic or sibilant, and there is marked indrawing of the
 34812	epigastrium and lower intercostal spaces. The hoarseness becomes more
 34813	marked, the cough more severe, and the patient restless. The difficulty
 34814	of breathing occurs in paroxysms, which gradually increase in frequency
 34815	and severity, until at length the patient becomes asphyxiated. The
 34816	duration of the disease varies from a few hours to four or five days.
 34817	
 34818	After the acute symptoms have passed off, various localised
 34819	paralyses may develop, affecting particularly the nerves of the palatal
 34820	and orbital muscles, less frequently the lower limbs.
 34821	
 34822	#Diagnosis.#--The finding of the Klebs-Loffler bacillus is the only
 34823	conclusive evidence of the disease. The bacillus may be obtained by
 34824	swabbing the throat with a piece of aseptic--not antiseptic--cotton wool
 34825	or clean linen rag held in a pair of forceps, and rotated so as to
 34826	entangle portions of the false membrane or exudate. The swab thus
 34827	obtained is placed in a test-tube, previously sterilised by having had
 34828	some water boiled in it, and sent to a laboratory for investigation. To
 34829	identify the bacillus a piece of the membrane from the swab is rubbed on
 34830	a cover glass, dried, and stained with methylene blue or other basic
 34831	stain; or cultures may be made on agar or other suitable medium. When a
 34832	bacteriological examination is impossible, or when the clinical features
 34833	do not coincide with the results obtained, the patient should always be
 34834	treated on the assumption that he suffers from diphtheria. So much doubt
 34835	exists as to the real nature of membranous croup and its relationship to
 34836	true diphtheria, that when the diagnosis between the two is uncertain
 34837	the safest plan is to treat the case as one of diphtheria.
 34838	
 34839	In children, diphtheria may occur on the vulva, vagina, prepuce, or
 34840	glans penis, and give rise to difficulty in diagnosis, which is only
 34841	cleared up by demonstration of the bacillus.
 34842	
 34843	#Treatment.#--An attempt may be made to destroy or to counteract the
 34844	organisms by swabbing the throat with strong antiseptic solutions, such
 34845	as 1 in 1000 corrosive sublimate or 1 in 30 carbolic acid, or by
 34846	spraying with peroxide of hydrogen.
 34847	
 34848	The antitoxic serum is our sheet-anchor in the treatment of diphtheria,
 34849	and recourse should be had to its use as early as possible.
 34850	
 34851	Difficulty of swallowing may be met by the use of a stomach tube passed
 34852	either through the mouth or nose. When this is impracticable, nutrient
 34853	enemata are called for.
 34854	
 34855	In laryngeal diphtheria, the interference with respiration may call for
 34856	intubation of the larynx, or tracheotomy, but the antitoxin treatment
 34857	has greatly diminished the number of cases in which it becomes necessary
 34858	to have recourse to these measures.
 34859	
 34860	Intubation consists in introducing through the mouth into the larynx a
 34861	tube which allows the patient to breathe freely during the period while
 34862	the membrane is becoming separated and thrown off. This is best done
 34863	with the apparatus of O'Dwyer; but when this instrument is not
 34864	available, a simple gum-elastic catheter with a terminal opening (as
 34865	suggested by Macewen and Annandale) may be employed.
 34866	
 34867	When intubation is impracticable, the operation of tracheotomy is
 34868	called for if the patient's life is endangered by embarrassment of
 34869	respiration. Unless the patient is in hospital with skilled assistance
 34870	available, tracheotomy is the safer of the two procedures.
 34871	
 34872	
 34873	TETANUS
 34874	
 34875	Tetanus is a disease resulting from infection of a wound by a specific
 34876	micro-organism, the _bacillus tetani_, and characterised by increased
 34877	reflex excitability, hypertonus, and spasm of one or more groups of
 34878	voluntary muscles.
 34879	
 34880	_Etiology and Morbid Anatomy._--The tetanus bacillus, which is a perfect
 34881	anaerobe, is widely distributed in nature and can be isolated from
 34882	garden earth, dung-heaps, and stable refuse. It is a slender rod-shaped
 34883	bacillus, with a single large spore at one end giving it the shape of a
 34884	drum-stick (Fig. 26). The spores, which are the active agents in
 34885	producing tetanus, are highly resistant to chemical agents, retain their
 34886	vitality in a dry condition, and even survive boiling for five minutes.
 34887	
 34888	The organism does not readily establish itself in the human body, and
 34889	seems to flourish best when it finds a nidus in necrotic tissue and is
 34890	accompanied by aerobic organisms, which, by using up the oxygen in the
 34891	tissues, provide for it a suitable environment. The presence of a
 34892	foreign body in the wound seems to favour its action. The infection is
 34893	for all practical purposes a local one, the symptoms of the disease
 34894	being due to the toxins produced in the wound of infection acting upon
 34895	the central nervous system.
 34896	
 34897	The toxin acts principally on the nerve centres in the spinal medulla,
 34898	to which it travels from the focus of infection by way of the nerve
 34899	fibres supplying the voluntary muscles. Its first effect on the motor
 34900	ganglia of the cord is to render them hypersensitive, so that they are
 34901	excited by mild stimuli, which under ordinary conditions would produce
 34902	no reaction. As the toxin accumulates the reflex arc is affected, with
 34903	the result that when a stimulus reaches the ganglia a motor discharge
 34904	takes place, which spreads by ascending and descending collaterals to
 34905	the reflex apparatus of the whole cord. As the toxin spreads it causes
 34906	both motor hyper-tonus and hyper-excitability, which accounts for the
 34907	tonic contraction and the clonic spasms characteristic of tetanus.
 34908	
 34909	[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Bacillus of Tetanus from scraping of a wound of
 34910	finger, x 1000 diam. Basic fuchsin stain.]
 34911	
 34912	#Clinical Varieties of Tetanus.#--_Acute_ or _Fulminating
 34913	Tetanus_.--This variety is characterised by the shortness of the
 34914	incubation period, the rapidity of its progress, the severity of its
 34915	symptoms, and its all but universally fatal issue in spite of
 34916	treatment, death taking place in from one to four days. The
 34917	characteristic symptoms may appear within three or four days of the
 34918	infliction of the wound, but the incubation period may extend to three
 34919	weeks, and the wound may be quite healed before the disease declares
 34920	itself--_delayed tetanus_. Usually, however, the wound is inflamed and
 34921	suppurating, with ragged and sloughy edges. A slight feverish attack may
 34922	mark the onset of the tetanic condition, or the patient may feel
 34923	perfectly well until the spasms begin. If careful observations be made,
 34924	it may be found that the muscles in the immediate neighbourhood of the
 34925	wound are the first to become contracted; but in the majority of
 34926	instances the patient's first complaint is of pain and stiffness in the
 34927	muscles of mastication, notably the masseter, so that he has difficulty
 34928	in opening the mouth--hence the popular name "lock-jaw." The muscles of
 34929	expression soon share in the rigidity, and the face assumes a taut,
 34930	mask-like aspect. The angles of the mouth may be retracted, producing a
 34931	grinning expression known as the _risus sardonicus_.
 34932	
 34933	The next muscles to become stiff and painful are those of the neck,
 34934	especially the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. The patient is inclined to
 34935	attribute the pain and stiffness to exposure to cold or rheumatism. At
 34936	an early stage the diaphragm and the muscles of the anterior abdominal
 34937	wall become contracted; later the muscles of the back and thorax are
 34938	involved; and lastly those of the limbs. Although this is the typical
 34939	order of involvement of the different groups of muscles, it is not
 34940	always adhered to.
 34941	
 34942	To this permanent tonic contraction of the muscles there are soon added
 34943	clonic spasms. These spasms are at first slight and transient, with
 34944	prolonged intervals between the attacks, but rapidly tend to become more
 34945	frequent, more severe, and of longer duration, until eventually the
 34946	patient simply passes out of one seizure into another.
 34947	
 34948	The distribution of the spasms varies in different cases: in some it is
 34949	confined to particular groups of muscles, such as those of the neck,
 34950	back, abdominal walls, or limbs; in others all these groups are
 34951	simultaneously involved.
 34952	
 34953	When the muscles of the back become spasmodically contracted, the body
 34954	is raised from the bed, sometimes to such an extent that the patient
 34955	rests only on his heels and occiput--the position of _opisthotonos_.
 34956	Lateral arching of the body from excessive action of the muscles on one
 34957	side--_pleurosthotonos_--is not uncommon, the arching usually taking
 34958	place towards the side on which the wound of infection exists. Less
 34959	frequently the body is bent forward so that the knees and chin almost
 34960	meet (_emprosthotonos_). Sometimes all the muscles simultaneously become
 34961	rigid, so that the body assumes a statuesque attitude (_orthotonos_).
 34962	When the thoracic muscles, including the diaphragm, are thrown into
 34963	spasm, the patient experiences a distressing sensation as if he were
 34964	gripped in a vice, and has extreme difficulty in getting breath. Between
 34965	the attacks the limbs are kept rigidly extended. The clonic spasms may
 34966	be so severe as to rupture muscles or even to fracture one of the long
 34967	bones.
 34968	
 34969	As time goes on, the clonic exacerbations become more and more frequent,
 34970	and the slightest external stimulus, such as the feeling of the pulse, a
 34971	whisper in the room, a noise in the street, a draught of cold air, the
 34972	effort to swallow, a question addressed to the patient or his attempt to
 34973	answer, is sufficient to determine an attack. The movements are so
 34974	forcible and so continuous that the nurse has great difficulty in
 34975	keeping the bedclothes on the patient, or even in keeping him in bed.
 34976	
 34977	The general condition of the patient is pitiful in the extreme. He is
 34978	fully conscious of the gravity of the disease, and his mind remains
 34979	clear to the end. The suffering induced by the cramp-like spasms of the
 34980	muscles keeps him in a constant state of fearful apprehension of the
 34981	next seizure, and he is unable to sleep until he becomes utterly
 34982	exhausted.
 34983	
 34984	The temperature is moderately raised (100 o to 102 o F.), or may remain
 34985	normal throughout. Shortly before death very high temperatures (110 o F.)
 34986	have been recorded, and it has been observed that the thermometer
 34987	sometimes continues to rise after death, and may reach as high as
 34988	112 o F. or more.
 34989	
 34990	The pulse corresponds with the febrile condition. It is accelerated
 34991	during the spasms, and may become exceedingly rapid and feeble before
 34992	death, probably from paralysis of the vagus. Sudden death from cardiac
 34993	paralysis or from cardiac spasm is not uncommon.
 34994	
 34995	The respiration is affected in so far as the spasms of the respiratory
 34996	muscles produce dyspnoea, and a feeling of impending suffocation which
 34997	adds to the horrors of the disease.
 34998	
 34999	One of the most constant symptoms is a copious perspiration, the patient
 35000	being literally bathed in sweat. The urine is diminished in quantity,
 35001	but as a rule is normal in composition; as in other acute infective
 35002	conditions, albumen and blood may be present. Retention of urine may
 35003	result from spasm of the urethral muscles, and necessitate the use of
 35004	the catheter.
 35005	
 35006	The fits may cease some time before death, or, on the other hand, death
 35007	may occur during a paroxysm from fixation of the diaphragm and arrest of
 35008	respiration.
 35009	
 35010	_Differential Diagnosis._--There is little difficulty, as a rule, in
 35011	diagnosing a case of fulminating tetanus, but there are several
 35012	conditions with which it may occasionally be confused. In _strychnin
 35013	poisoning_, for example, the spasms come on immediately after the
 35014	patient has taken a toxic dose of the drug; they are clonic in
 35015	character, but the muscles are relaxed between the fits. If the dose is
 35016	not lethal, the spasms soon cease. In _hydrophobia_ a history of having
 35017	been bitten by a rabid animal is usually forthcoming; the spasms, which
 35018	are clonic in character, affect chiefly the muscles of respiration and
 35019	deglutition, and pass off entirely in the intervals between attacks.
 35020	Certain cases of _haemorrhage into the lateral ventricles_ of the brain
 35021	also simulate tetanus, but an analysis of the symptoms will prevent
 35022	errors in diagnosis. _Cerebro-spinal meningitis_ and _basal meningitis_
 35023	present certain superficial resemblances to tetanus, but there is no
 35024	trismus, and the spasms chiefly affect the muscles of the neck and
 35025	back. _Hysteria and catalepsy_ may assume characters resembling those
 35026	of tetanus, but there is little difficulty in distinguishing between
 35027	these diseases. Lastly, in the _tetany_ of children, or that following
 35028	operations on the thyreoid gland, the spasms are of a jerking character,
 35029	affect chiefly the hands and fingers, and yield to medicinal treatment.
 35030	
 35031	#Chronic Tetanus.#--The difference between this and acute tetanus is
 35032	mainly one of degree. Its incubation period is longer, it is more slow
 35033	and insidious in its progress, and it never reaches the same degree of
 35034	severity. Trismus is the most marked and constant form of spasm; and
 35035	while the trunk muscles may be involved, those of respiration as a rule
 35036	escape. Every additional day the patient lives adds to the probability
 35037	of his ultimate recovery. When the disease does prove fatal, it is from
 35038	exhaustion, and not from respiratory or cardiac spasm. The usual
 35039	duration is from six to ten weeks.
 35040	
 35041	#Delayed Tetanus.#--During the European War acute tetanus occasionally
 35042	developed many weeks or even months after a patient had been injured,
 35043	and when the original wound had completely healed. It usually followed
 35044	some secondary operation, _e.g._, for the removal of a foreign body, or
 35045	the breaking down of adhesions, which aroused latent organisms.
 35046	
 35047	#Local Tetanus.#--This term is applied to a form of the disease in which
 35048	the hypertonus and spasms are localised to the muscles in the vicinity
 35049	of the wound. It usually occurs in patients who have had prophylactic
 35050	injections of anti-tetanic serum, the toxins entering the blood being
 35051	probably neutralised by the antibodies in circulation, while those
 35052	passing along the motor nerves are unaffected.
 35053	
 35054	When it occurs in the _limbs_, attention is usually directed to the fact
 35055	by pain accompanying the spasms; the muscles are found to be hard and
 35056	there are frequent twitchings of the limb. A characteristic reflex is
 35057	present in the lower extremity, namely, extension of the foot and leg
 35058	when the sole is tickled.
 35059	
 35060	_Cephalic Tetanus_ is another localised variety which follows injury in
 35061	the distribution of the facial nerve. It is characterised by the
 35062	occurrence on the same side as the injury, of facial spasm, rapidly
 35063	followed by more or less complete paralysis of the muscles of
 35064	expression, with unilateral trismus and difficulty in swallowing. Other
 35065	cranial nerves, particularly the oculomotor and the hypoglossal, may
 35066	also be implicated. A remarkable feature of this condition is that
 35067	although the muscles are irresponsive to ordinary physiological stimuli,
 35068	they are thrown into spasm by the abnormal impulses of tetanus.
 35069	
 35070	_Trismus._--This term is used to denote a form of tetanic spasm limited
 35071	to the muscles of mastication. It is really a mild form of chronic
 35072	tetanus, and the prognosis is favourable. It must not be confused with
 35073	the fixation of the jaw sometimes associated with a wisdom-tooth
 35074	gumboil, with tonsillitis, or with affections of the temporo-mandibular
 35075	articulation.
 35076	
 35077	_Tetanus neonatorum_ is a form of tetanus occurring in infants of about
 35078	a week old. Infection takes place through the umbilicus, and manifests
 35079	itself clinically by spasms of the muscles of mastication. It is almost
 35080	invariably fatal within a few days.
 35081	
 35082	_Prophylaxis._--Experience in the European War has established the
 35083	fact that the routine injection of anti-tetanic serum to all patients
 35084	with lacerated and contaminated wounds greatly reduces the frequency of
 35085	tetanus. The sooner the serum is given after the injury, the more
 35086	certain is its effect; within twenty-four hours 1500 units injected
 35087	subcutaneously is sufficient for the initial dose; if a longer period
 35088	has elapsed, 2000 to 3000 units should be given intra-muscularly, as
 35089	this ensures more rapid absorption. A second injection is given a week
 35090	after the first.
 35091	
 35092	The wound must be purified in the usual way, and all instruments and
 35093	appliances used for operations on tetanic patients must be immediately
 35094	sterilised by prolonged boiling.
 35095	
 35096	_Treatment._--When tetanus has developed the main indications are to
 35097	prevent the further production of toxins in the wound, and to neutralise
 35098	those that have been absorbed into the nervous system. Thorough
 35099	purification with antiseptics, excision of devitalised tissues, and
 35100	drainage of the wound are first carried out. To arrest the absorption of
 35101	toxins intra-muscular injections of 10,000 units of serum are given
 35102	daily into the muscles of the affected limb, or directly into the nerve
 35103	trunks leading from the focus of infection, in the hope of "blocking"
 35104	the nerves with antitoxin and so preventing the passage of toxins
 35105	towards the spinal cord.
 35106	
 35107	To neutralise the toxins that have already reached the spinal cord, 5000
 35108	units should be injected intra-thecally daily for four or five days, the
 35109	foot of the bed being raised to enable the serum to reach the upper
 35110	parts of the cord.
 35111	
 35112	The quantity of toxin circulating in the blood is so small as to be
 35113	practically negligible, and the risk of anaphylactic shock attending
 35114	intra-venous injection outweighs any benefit likely to follow this
 35115	procedure.
 35116	
 35117	Baccelli recommends the injection of 20 c.c. of a 1 in 100 solution of
 35118	carbolic acid into the subcutaneous tissues every four hours during the
 35119	period that the contractions persist. Opinions vary as to the
 35120	efficiency of this treatment. The intra-thecal injection of 10 c.c. of a
 35121	15 per cent. solution of magnesium sulphate has proved beneficial in
 35122	alleviating the severity of the spasms, but does not appear to have a
 35123	curative effect.
 35124	
 35125	To conserve the patient's strength by preventing or diminishing the
 35126	severity of the spasms, he should be placed in a quiet room, and every
 35127	form of disturbance avoided. Sedatives, such as bromides, paraldehyde,
 35128	or opium, must be given in large doses. Chloral is perhaps the best, and
 35129	the patient should rarely have less than 150 grains in twenty-four
 35130	hours. When he is unable to swallow, it should be given by the rectum.
 35131	The administration of chloroform is of value in conserving the strength
 35132	of the patient, by abolishing the spasms, and enabling the attendants to
 35133	administer nourishment or drugs either through a stomach tube or by the
 35134	rectum. Extreme elevation of temperature is met by tepid sponging. It is
 35135	necessary to use the catheter if retention of urine occurs.
 35136	
 35137	
 35138	HYDROPHOBIA
 35139	
 35140	Hydrophobia is an acute infective disease following on the bite of a
 35141	rabid animal. It most commonly follows the bite or lick of a rabid dog
 35142	or cat. The virus appears to be communicated through the saliva of the
 35143	animal, and to show a marked affinity for nerve tissues; and the disease
 35144	is most likely to develop when the patient is infected on the face or
 35145	other uncovered part, or in a part richly endowed with nerves.
 35146	
 35147	A dog which has bitten a person should on no account be killed until its
 35148	condition has been proved one way or the other. Should rabies develop
 35149	and its destruction become necessary, the head and spinal cord should be
 35150	retained and forwarded, packed in ice, to a competent observer. Much
 35151	anxiety to the person bitten and to his friends would be avoided if
 35152	these rules were observed, because in many cases it will be shown that
 35153	the animal did not after all suffer from rabies, and that the patient
 35154	consequently runs no risk. If, on the other hand, rabies is proved to be
 35155	present, the patient should be submitted to the Pasteur treatment.
 35156	
 35157	_Clinical Features._--There is almost always a history of the patient
 35158	having been bitten or licked by an animal supposed to suffer from
 35159	rabies. The incubation period averages about forty days, but varies from
 35160	a fortnight to seven or eight months, and is shorter in young than in
 35161	old persons. The original wound has long since healed, and beyond a
 35162	slight itchiness or pain shooting along the nerves of the part, shows no
 35163	sign of disturbance. A few days of general malaise, with chills and
 35164	giddiness precede the onset of the acute manifestations, which affect
 35165	chiefly the muscles of deglutition and respiration. One of the earliest
 35166	signs is that the patient has periodically a sudden catch in his
 35167	breathing "resembling what often occurs when a person goes into a cold
 35168	bath." This is due to spasm of the diaphragm, and is frequently
 35169	accompanied by a loud-sounding hiccough, likened by the laity to the
 35170	barking of a dog. Difficulty in swallowing fluids may be the first
 35171	symptom.
 35172	
 35173	The spasms rapidly spread to all the muscles of deglutition and
 35174	respiration, so that the patient not only has the greatest difficulty in
 35175	swallowing, but has a constant sense of impending suffocation. To add to
 35176	his distress, a copious secretion of viscid saliva fills his mouth. Any
 35177	voluntary effort, as well as all forms of external stimuli, only serve
 35178	to aggravate the spasms which are always induced by the attempt to
 35179	swallow fluid, or even by the sound of running water.
 35180	
 35181	The temperature is raised; the pulse is small, rapid, and intermittent;
 35182	and the urine may contain sugar and albumen.
 35183	
 35184	The mind may remain clear to the end, or the patient may have delusions,
 35185	supposing himself to be surrounded by terrifying forms. There is always
 35186	extreme mental agitation and despair, and the sufferer is in constant
 35187	fear of his impending fate. Happily the inevitable issue is not long
 35188	delayed, death usually occurring in from two to four days from the
 35189	onset. The symptoms of the disease are so characteristic that there is
 35190	no difficulty in diagnosis. The only condition with which it is liable
 35191	to be confused is the variety of cephalic tetanus in which the muscles
 35192	of deglutition are specially involved--the so-called tetanus
 35193	hydrophobicus.
 35194	
 35195	_Prophylaxis._--The bite of an animal suspected of being rabid should be
 35196	cauterised at once by means of the actual or Paquelin cautery, or by a
 35197	strong chemical escharotic such as pure carbolic acid, after which
 35198	antiseptic dressings are applied.
 35199	
 35200	It is, however, to Pasteur's _preventive inoculation_ that we must look
 35201	for our best hope of averting the onset of symptoms. "It may now be
 35202	taken as established that a grave responsibility rests on those
 35203	concerned if a person bitten by a mad animal is not subjected to the
 35204	Pasteur treatment" (Muir and Ritchie).
 35205	
 35206	This method is based on the fact that the long incubation period of the
 35207	disease admits of the patient being inoculated with a modified virus
 35208	producing a mild attack, which protects him from the natural disease.
 35209	
 35210	_Treatment._--When the symptoms have once developed they can only be
 35211	palliated. The patient must be kept absolutely quiet and free from all
 35212	sources of irritation. The spasms may be diminished by means of chloral
 35213	and bromides, or by chloroform inhalation.
 35214	
 35215	
 35216	ANTHRAX
 35217	
 35218	Anthrax is a comparatively rare disease, communicable to man from
 35219	certain of the lower animals, such as sheep, oxen, horses, deer, and
 35220	other herbivora. In animals it is characterised by symptoms of acute
 35221	general poisoning, and, from the fact that it produces a marked
 35222	enlargement of the spleen, is known in veterinary surgery as "splenic
 35223	fever."
 35224	
 35225	The _bacillus anthracis_ (Fig. 27), the largest of the known pathogenic
 35226	bacteria, occurs in groups or in chains made up of numerous bacilli,
 35227	each bacillus measuring from 6 to 8 u in length. The organisms are found
 35228	in enormous numbers throughout the bodies of animals that have died of
 35229	anthrax, and are readily recognised and cultivated. Sporulation only
 35230	takes place outside the body, probably because free oxygen is necessary
 35231	to the process. In the spore-free condition, the organisms are readily
 35232	destroyed by ordinary germicides, and by the gastric juice. The spores,
 35233	on the other hand, have a high degree of resistance. Not only do they
 35234	remain viable in the dry state for long periods, even up to a year, but
 35235	they survive boiling for five minutes, and must be subjected to dry heat
 35236	at 140 o C. for several hours before they are destroyed.
 35237	
 35238	[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Bacillus of Anthrax in section of skin, from a
 35239	case of malignant pustule; shows vesicle containing bacilli. x 400 diam.
 35240	Gram's stain.]
 35241	
 35242	_Clinical Varieties of Anthrax._--In man, anthrax may manifest itself in
 35243	one of three clinical forms.
 35244	
 35245	It may be transmitted by means of spores or bacilli directly from a
 35246	diseased animal to those who, by their occupation or otherwise, are
 35247	brought into contact with it--for example, shepherds, butchers,
 35248	veterinary surgeons, or hide-porters. Infection may occur on the face by
 35249	the use of a shaving-brush contaminated by spores. The path of infection
 35250	is usually through an abrasion of the skin, and the primary
 35251	manifestations are local, constituting what is known as _the malignant
 35252	pustule_.
 35253	
 35254	In other cases the disease is contracted through the inhalation of the
 35255	dried spores into the respiratory passages. This occurs oftenest in
 35256	those who work amongst wool, fur, and rags, and a form of acute
 35257	pneumonia of great virulence ensues. This affection is known as
 35258	_wool-sorter's disease_, and is almost universally fatal.
 35259	
 35260	There is reason to believe that infection may also take place by means
 35261	of spores ingested into the alimentary canal in meat or milk derived
 35262	from diseased animals, or in infected water.
 35263	
 35264	#Clinical Features of Malignant Pustule.#--We shall here confine
 35265	ourselves to the consideration of the local lesion as it occurs in the
 35266	skin--_the malignant pustule_.
 35267	
 35268	The point of infection is usually on an uncovered part of the body, such
 35269	as the face, hands, arms, or back of the neck, and the wound may be
 35270	exceedingly minute. After an incubation period varying from a few hours
 35271	to several days, a reddish nodule resembling a small boil appears at the
 35272	seat of inoculation, the immediately surrounding skin becomes swollen
 35273	and indurated, and over the indurated area there appear a number of
 35274	small vesicles containing serum, which at first is clear but soon
 35275	becomes blood-stained (Fig. 28). Coincidently the subcutaneous tissue
 35276	for a considerable distance around becomes markedly oedematous, and the
 35277	skin red and tense. Within a few hours, blood is extravasated in the
 35278	centre of the indurated area, the blisters burst, and a dark brown or
 35279	black eschar, composed of necrosed skin and subcutaneous tissue and
 35280	altered blood, forms (Fig. 29). Meanwhile the induration extends, fresh
 35281	vesicles form and in turn burst, and the eschar increases in size. The
 35282	neighbouring lymph glands soon become swollen and tender. The affected
 35283	part is hot and itchy, but the patient does not complain of great pain.
 35284	There is a moderate degree of constitutional disturbance, with headache,
 35285	nausea, and sometimes shivering.
 35286	
 35287	If the infection becomes generalised--_anthracaemia_--the temperature
 35288	rises to 103 o or 104 o F., the pulse becomes feeble and rapid, and other
 35289	signs of severe blood-poisoning appear: vomiting, diarrhoea, pains in the
 35290	limbs, headache and delirium, and the condition proves fatal in from
 35291	five to eight days.
 35292	
 35293	_Differential Diagnosis._--When the malignant pustule is fully
 35294	developed, the central slough with the surrounding vesicles and the
 35295	widespread oedema are characteristic. The bacillus can be obtained from
 35296	the peripheral portion of the slough, from the blisters, and from the
 35297	adjacent lymph vessels and glands. The occupation of the patient may
 35298	suggest the possibility of anthrax infection.
 35299	
 35300	[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Malignant Pustule, third day after infection
 35301	with Anthrax, showing great oedema of upper extremity and pectoral region
 35302	(cf. Fig. 29).]
 35303	
 35304	[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Malignant Pustule, fourteen days after
 35305	infection, showing black eschar in process of separation. The oedema has
 35306	largely disappeared. Treated by Sclavo's serum (cf. Fig. 28).]
 35307	
 35308	_Prophylaxis._--Any wound suspected of being infected with anthrax
 35309	should at once be cauterised with caustic potash, the actual cautery, or
 35310	pure carbolic acid.
 35311	
 35312	_Treatment._--The best results hitherto obtained have followed the use
 35313	of the anti-anthrax serum introduced by Sclavo. The initial dose is 40
 35314	c.c., and if the serum is given early in the disease, the beneficial
 35315	effects are manifest in a few hours. Favourable results have also
 35316	followed the use of pyocyanase, a vaccine prepared from the bacillus
 35317	pyocyaneus.
 35318	
 35319	By some it is recommended that the local lesion should be freely
 35320	excised; others advocate cauterisation of the affected part with solid
 35321	caustic potash till all the indurated area is softened. Graf has had
 35322	excellent results by the latter method in a large series of cases, the
 35323	oedema subsiding in about twenty-four hours and the constitutional
 35324	symptoms rapidly improving. Wolff and Wiewiorowski, on the other hand,
 35325	have had equally good results by simply protecting the local lesion with
 35326	a mild antiseptic dressing, and relying upon general treatment.
 35327	
 35328	The general treatment consists in feeding and stimulating the patient as
 35329	freely as possible. Quinine, in 5 to 10 grain doses every four hours,
 35330	and powdered ipecacuanha, in 40 to 60 grain doses every four hours, have
 35331	also been employed with apparent benefit.
 35332	
 35333	
 35334	GLANDERS
 35335	
 35336	Glanders is due to the action of a specific bacterium, the _bacillus
 35337	mallei_, which resembles the tubercle bacillus, save that it is somewhat
 35338	shorter and broader, and does not stain by Gram's method. It requires
 35339	higher temperatures for its cultivation than the tubercle bacillus, and
 35340	its growth on potato is of a characteristic chocolate-brown colour, with
 35341	a greenish-yellow ring at the margin of the growth. The bacillus mallei
 35342	retains its vitality for long periods under ordinary conditions, but is
 35343	readily killed by heat and chemical agents. It does not form spores.
 35344	
 35345	_Clinical Features._--Both in the lower animals and in man the bacillus
 35346	gives rise to two distinct types of disease--_acute glanders_, and
 35347	_chronic glanders_ or _farcy_.
 35348	
 35349	Acute Glanders is most commonly met with in the horse and in other
 35350	equine animals, horned cattle being immune. It affects the septum of the
 35351	nose and adjacent parts, firm, translucent, greyish nodules containing
 35352	lymphoid and epithelioid cells appearing in the mucous membrane. These
 35353	nodules subsequently break down in the centre, forming irregular
 35354	ulcers, which are attended with profuse discharge, and marked
 35355	inflammatory swelling. The cervical lymph glands, as well as the lungs,
 35356	spleen, and liver, may be the seat of secondary nodules.
 35357	
 35358	_In man_, acute glanders is commoner than the chronic variety. Infection
 35359	always takes place through an abraded surface, and usually on one of the
 35360	uncovered parts of the body--most commonly the skin of the hands, arms,
 35361	or face; or on the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eye. The
 35362	disease has been acquired by accidental inoculation in the course of
 35363	experimental investigations in the laboratory, and proved fatal. The
 35364	incubation period is from three to five days.
 35365	
 35366	The _local_ manifestations are pain and swelling in the region of the
 35367	infected wound, with inflammatory redness around it and along the lines
 35368	of the superficial lymphatics. In the course of a week, small, firm
 35369	nodules appear, and are rapidly transformed into pustules. These may
 35370	occur on the face and in the vicinity of joints, and may be mistaken for
 35371	the eruption of small-pox.
 35372	
 35373	After breaking down, these pustules give rise to irregular ulcers, which
 35374	by their confluence lead to extensive destruction of skin. Sometimes the
 35375	nasal mucous membrane becomes affected, and produces a discharge--at
 35376	first watery, but later sanious and purulent. Necrosis of the bones of
 35377	the nose may take place, in which case the discharge becomes peculiarly
 35378	offensive. In nearly every case metastatic abscesses form in different
 35379	parts of the body, such as the lungs, joints, or muscles.
 35380	
 35381	During the development of the disease the patient feels ill, complains
 35382	of headache and pains in the limbs, the temperature rises to 104 o or
 35383	even to 106 o F., and assumes a pyaemic type. The pulse becomes rapid and
 35384	weak. The tongue is dry and brown. There is profuse sweating,
 35385	albuminuria, and often insomnia with delirium. Death may take place
 35386	within a week, but more frequently occurs during the second or third
 35387	week.
 35388	
 35389	_Differential Diagnosis._--There is nothing characteristic in the site
 35390	of the primary lesion in man, and the condition may, during the early
 35391	stages, be mistaken for a boil or carbuncle, or for any acute
 35392	inflammatory condition. Later, the disease may simulate acute articular
 35393	rheumatism, or may manifest all the symptoms of acute septicaemia or
 35394	pyaemia. The diagnosis is established by the recognition of the bacillus.
 35395	Veterinary surgeons attach great importance to the mallein test as a
 35396	means of diagnosis in animals, but in the human subject its use is
 35397	attended with considerable risk and is not to be recommended.
 35398	
 35399	_Treatment._--Excision of the primary nodule, followed by the
 35400	application of the thermo-cautery and sponging with pure carbolic acid,
 35401	should be carried out, provided the condition is sufficiently limited to
 35402	render complete removal practicable.
 35403	
 35404	When secondary abscesses form in accessible situations, they must be
 35405	incised, disinfected, and drained. The general treatment is carried out
 35406	on the same lines as in other acute infective diseases.
 35407	
 35408	#Chronic Glanders.#--_In the horse_ the chronic form of glanders is
 35409	known as _farcy_, and follows infection through an abrasion of the skin,
 35410	involving chiefly the superficial lymph vessels and glands. The
 35411	lymphatics become indurated and nodular, constituting what veterinarians
 35412	call _farcy pipes_ and _farcy buds_.
 35413	
 35414	_In man_ also the clinical features of the chronic variety of the
 35415	disease are somewhat different from those of the acute form. Here, too,
 35416	infection takes place through a broken cutaneous surface, and leads to a
 35417	superficial lymphangitis with nodular thickening of the lymphatics
 35418	(_farcy buds_). The neighbouring glands soon become swollen and
 35419	indurated. The primary lesion meanwhile inflames, suppurates, and, after
 35420	breaking down, leaves a large, irregular ulcer with thickened edges and
 35421	a foul, purulent or bloody discharge. The glands break down in the same
 35422	way, and lead to wide destruction of skin, and the resulting sinuses and
 35423	ulcers are exceedingly intractable. Secondary deposits in the
 35424	subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, and other parts, are not uncommon, and
 35425	the nasal mucous membrane may become involved. The disease often runs a
 35426	chronic course, extending to four or five months, or even longer.
 35427	Recovery takes place in about 50 per cent. of cases, but the
 35428	convalescence is prolonged, and at any time the disease may assume the
 35429	characters of the acute variety and speedily prove fatal.
 35430	
 35431	The _differential diagnosis_ is often difficult, especially in the
 35432	chronic nodules, in which it may be impossible to demonstrate the
 35433	bacillus. The ulcerated lesions of farcy have to be distinguished from
 35434	those of tubercle, syphilis, and other forms of infective granuloma.
 35435	
 35436	_Treatment._--Limited areas of disease should be completely excised. The
 35437	general condition of the patient must be improved by tonics, good food,
 35438	and favourable hygienic surroundings. In some cases potassium iodide
 35439	acts beneficially.
 35440	
 35441	
 35442	ACTINOMYCOSIS
 35443	
 35444	Actinomycosis is a chronic disease due to the action of an organism
 35445	somewhat higher in the vegetable scale than ordinary bacteria--the
 35446	_streptothrix actinomyces_ or _ray fungus_.
 35447	
 35448	[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Section of Actinomycosis Colony in Pus from
 35449	Abscess of Liver, showing filaments and clubs of streptothrix
 35450	actinomyces. x 400 diam. Gram's stain.]
 35451	
 35452	_Etiology and Morbid Anatomy._--The actinomyces, which has never been
 35453	met with outside the body, gives rise in oxen, horses, and other animals
 35454	to tumour-like masses composed of granulation tissue; and in man to
 35455	chronic suppurative processes which may result in a condition resembling
 35456	chronic pyaemia. The actinomyces is more complex in structure than other
 35457	pathogenic organisms, and occurs in the tissues in the form of small,
 35458	round, semi-translucent bodies, about the size of a pin-head or less,
 35459	and consisting of colonies of the fungus. On account of their yellow
 35460	tint they are spoken of as "sulphur grains." Each colony is made up of a
 35461	series of thin, interlacing, and branching _filaments_, some of which
 35462	are broken up so as to form masses or chains of _cocci_; and around the
 35463	periphery of the colony are elongated, pear-shaped, hyaline, _club-like
 35464	bodies_ (Fig. 30).
 35465	
 35466	Infection is believed to be conveyed by the husks of cereals, especially
 35467	barley; and the organism has been found adhering to particles of grain
 35468	embedded in the tissues of animals suffering from the disease. In the
 35469	human subject there is often a history of exposure to infection from
 35470	such sources, and the disease is said to be most common during the
 35471	harvesting months.
 35472	
 35473	Around each colony of actinomyces is a zone of granulation tissue in
 35474	which suppuration usually occurs, so that the fungus comes to lie in a
 35475	bath of greenish-yellow pus. As the process spreads these purulent foci
 35476	become confluent and form abscess cavities. When metastasis takes place,
 35477	as it occasionally does, the fungus is transmitted by the blood vessels,
 35478	as in pyaemia.
 35479	
 35480	_Clinical features._--In man the disease may be met with in the skin,
 35481	the organisms gaining access through an abrasion, and spreading by the
 35482	formation of new nodules in the same way as tuberculosis.
 35483	
 35484	The region of the mouth and jaws is one of the commonest sites of
 35485	surgical actinomycosis. Infection takes place, as a rule, along the side
 35486	of a carious tooth, and spreads to the lower jaw. A swelling is slowly
 35487	and insidiously developed, but when the loose connective tissue of the
 35488	neck becomes infiltrated, the spread is more rapid. The whole region
 35489	becomes infiltrated and swollen, and the skin ultimately gives way and
 35490	free suppuration occurs, resulting in the formation of sinuses. The
 35491	characteristic greenish-grey or yellow granules are seen in the pus, and
 35492	when examined microscopically reveal the colonies of actinomyces.
 35493	
 35494	Less frequently the maxilla becomes affected, and the disease may spread
 35495	to the base of the skull and brain. The vertebrae may become involved by
 35496	infection taking place through the pharynx or oesophagus, and leading to
 35497	a condition simulating tuberculous disease of the spine. When it
 35498	implicates the intestinal canal and its accessory glands, the lungs,
 35499	pleura, and bronchial tubes, or the brain, the disease is not amenable
 35500	to surgical treatment.
 35501	
 35502	_Differential Diagnosis._--The conditions likely to be mistaken for
 35503	surgical actinomycosis are sarcoma, tubercle, and syphilis. In the early
 35504	stages the differential diagnosis is exceedingly difficult. In many
 35505	cases it is only possible when suppuration has occurred and the fungus
 35506	can be demonstrated.
 35507	
 35508	The slow destruction of the affected tissue by suppuration, the absence
 35509	of pain, tenderness, and redness, simulate tuberculosis, but the absence
 35510	of glandular involvement helps to distinguish it.
 35511	
 35512	Syphilitic lesions are liable to be mistaken for actinomycosis, all the
 35513	more that in both diseases improvement follows the administration of
 35514	iodides. When it affects the lower jaw, in its early stages,
 35515	actinomycosis may closely simulate a periosteal sarcoma.
 35516	
 35517	[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Actinomycosis of Maxilla. The disease spread to
 35518	opposite side; finally implicated base of skull, and proved fatal.
 35519	Treated by radium.
 35520	
 35521	(Mr. D. P. D. Wilkie's case.)]
 35522	
 35523	The recognition of the fungus is the crucial point in diagnosis.
 35524	
 35525	_Prognosis._--Spontaneous cure rarely occurs. When the disease
 35526	implicates internal organs, it is almost always fatal. On external parts
 35527	the destructive process gradually spreads, and the patient eventually
 35528	succumbs to superadded septic infection. When, from its situation, the
 35529	primary focus admits of removal, the prognosis is more favourable.
 35530	
 35531	_Treatment._--The surgical treatment is early and free removal of the
 35532	affected tissues, after which the wound is cauterised by the actual
 35533	cautery, and sponged over with pure carbolic acid. The cavity is packed
 35534	with iodoform gauze, no attempt being made to close the wound.
 35535	
 35536	Success has attended the use of a vaccine prepared from cultures of the
 35537	organism; and the X-rays and radium, combined with the administration of
 35538	iodides in large doses, or with intra-muscular injections of a 10 per
 35539	cent. solution of cacodylate of soda, have proved of benefit.
 35540	
 35541	MYCETOMA, OR MADURA FOOT.--Mycetoma is a chronic disease due to
 35542	an organism resembling that of actinomycosis, but not identical with it.
 35543	It is endemic in certain tropical countries, and is most frequently met
 35544	with in India. Infection takes place through an abrasion of the skin,
 35545	and the disease usually occurs on the feet of adult males who work
 35546	barefooted in the fields.
 35547	
 35548	_Clinical Features._--The disease begins on the foot as an indurated
 35549	patch, which becomes discoloured and permeated by black or yellow
 35550	nodules containing the organism. These nodules break down by
 35551	suppuration, and numerous minute abscesses lined by granulation tissues
 35552	are thus formed. In the pus are found yellow particles likened to
 35553	fish-roe, or black pigmented granules like gunpowder. Sinuses form, and
 35554	the whole foot becomes greatly swollen and distorted by flattening of
 35555	the sole and dorsiflexion of the toes. Areas of caries or necrosis occur
 35556	in the bones, and the disease gradually extends up the leg (Fig. 32).
 35557	There is but little pain, and no glandular involvement or constitutional
 35558	disturbance. The disease runs a prolonged course, sometimes lasting for
 35559	twenty or thirty years. Spontaneous cure never takes place, and the risk
 35560	to life is that of prolonged suppuration.
 35561	
 35562	If the disease is localised, it may be removed by the knife or sharp
 35563	spoon, and the part afterwards cauterised. As a rule, amputation well
 35564	above the disease is the best line of treatment. Unlike actinomycosis,
 35565	this disease does not appear to be benefited by iodides.
 35566	
 35567	[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Mycetoma, or Madura Foot. (Museum of Royal
 35568	College of Surgeons, Edinburgh.)]
 35569	
 35570	DELHI BOIL.--_Synonyms_--Aleppo boil, Biskra button, Furunculus
 35571	orientalis, Natal sore.
 35572	
 35573	Delhi boil is a chronic inflammatory disease, most commonly met with in
 35574	India, especially towards the end of the wet season. The disease occurs
 35575	oftenest on the face, and is believed to be due to an organism, although
 35576	this has not been demonstrated. The infection is supposed to be conveyed
 35577	through water used for washing, or by the bites of insects.
 35578	
 35579	_Clinical Features._--A red spot, resembling the mark of a mosquito
 35580	bite, appears on the affected part, and is attended with itching. After
 35581	becoming papular and increasing to the size of a pea, desquamation takes
 35582	place, leaving a dull-red surface, over which in the course of several
 35583	weeks there develops a series of small yellowish-white spots, from which
 35584	serum exudes, and, drying, forms a thick scab. Under this scab the skin
 35585	ulcerates, leaving small oval sores with sharply bevelled edges, and an
 35586	uneven floor covered with yellow or sanious pus. These sores vary in
 35587	number from one to forty or fifty. They may last for months and then
 35588	heal spontaneously, or may continue to spread until arrested by suitable
 35589	treatment. There is no enlargement of adjacent glands, and but little
 35590	inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissues; nor is there any
 35591	marked constitutional disturbance. Recovery is often followed by
 35592	cicatricial contraction leading to deformity of the face.
 35593	
 35594	The _treatment_ consists in destroying the original papule by the actual
 35595	cautery, acid nitrate of mercury, or pure carbolic acid. The ulcers
 35596	should be scraped with the sharp spoon, and cauterised.
 35597	
 35598	CHIGOE.--Chigoe or jigger results from the introduction of the
 35599	eggs of the sand-flea (_Pulex penetrans_) into the tissues. It occurs in
 35600	tropical Africa, South America, and the West Indies. The impregnated
 35601	female flea remains attached to the part till the eggs mature, when by
 35602	their irritation they cause localised inflammation with pustules or
 35603	vesicles on the surface. Children are most commonly attacked,
 35604	particularly about the toe-nails and on the scrotum. The treatment
 35605	consists in picking out the insect with a blunt needle, special care
 35606	being taken not to break it up. The puncture is then cauterised. The
 35607	application of essential oils to the feet acts as a preventive.
 35608	
 35609	POISONING BY INSECTS.--The bites of certain insects, such as
 35610	mosquitoes, midges, different varieties of flies, wasps, and spiders,
 35611	may be followed by serious complications. The effects are mainly due to
 35612	the injection of an irritant acid secretion, the exact nature of which
 35613	has not been ascertained.
 35614	
 35615	The local lesion is a puncture, surrounded by a zone of hyperaemia,
 35616	wheals, or vesicles, and is associated with burning sensations and
 35617	itching which usually pass off in a few hours, but may recur at
 35618	intervals, especially when the patient is warm in bed. Scratching also
 35619	reproduces the local signs and symptoms. Where the connective tissue is
 35620	loose--for example, in the eyelid or scrotum--there is often
 35621	considerable swelling; and in the mouth and fauces this may lead to
 35622	oedema of the glottis, which may prove fatal.
 35623	
 35624	The _treatment_ consists in the local application of dilute alkalies
 35625	such as ammonia water, solutions of carbonate or bicarbonate of soda, or
 35626	sal-volatile. Weak carbolic lotions, or lead and opium lotion, are
 35627	useful in allaying the local irritation. One of the best means of
 35628	neutralising the poison is to apply to the sting a drop of a mixture
 35629	containing equal parts of pure carbolic acid and liquor ammoniae.
 35630	
 35631	Free stimulation is called for when severe constitutional symptoms are
 35632	present.
 35633	
 35634	SNAKE-BITES.--We are here only concerned with the injuries
 35635	inflicted by the venomous varieties of snakes, the most important of
 35636	which are the hooded snakes of India, the rattle-snakes of America, the
 35637	horned snakes of Africa, the viper of Europe, and the adder of the
 35638	United Kingdom.
 35639	
 35640	While the virulence of these creatures varies widely, they are all
 35641	capable of producing in a greater or less degree symptoms of acute
 35642	poisoning in man and other animals. By means of two recurved fangs
 35643	attached to the upper jaw, and connected by a duct with poison-secreting
 35644	glands, they introduce into their prey a thick, transparent, yellowish
 35645	fluid, of acid reaction, probably of the nature of an albumose, and
 35646	known as the _venom_.
 35647	
 35648	The _clinical features_ resulting from the injection of the venom vary
 35649	directly in intensity with the amount of the poison introduced, and the
 35650	rapidity with which it reaches the circulating blood, being most marked
 35651	when it immediately enters a large vein. The poison is innocuous when
 35652	taken into the stomach.
 35653	
 35654	_Locally_ the snake inflicts a double wound, passing vertically into the
 35655	subcutaneous tissue; the edges of the punctures are ecchymosed, and the
 35656	adjacent vessels the seat of thrombosis. Immediately there is intense
 35657	pain, and considerable swelling with congestion, which tends to spread
 35658	towards the trunk. Extensive gangrene may ensue. There is no special
 35659	involvement of the lymphatics.
 35660	
 35661	The _general symptoms_ may come on at once if the snake is a
 35662	particularly venomous one, or not for some hours if less virulent. In
 35663	the majority of viper or adder bites the constitutional disturbance is
 35664	slight and transient, if it appears at all. Snake-bites in children are
 35665	particularly dangerous.
 35666	
 35667	The patient's condition is one of profound shock with faintness,
 35668	giddiness, dimness of sight, and a feeling of great terror. The pupils
 35669	dilate, the skin becomes moist with a clammy sweat, and nausea with
 35670	vomiting, sometimes of blood, ensues. High fever, cramps, loss of
 35671	sensation, haematuria, and melaena are among the other symptoms that may
 35672	be present. The pulse becomes feeble and rapid, the respiratory nerve
 35673	centres are profoundly depressed, and delirium followed by coma usually
 35674	precedes the fatal issue, which may take place in from five to
 35675	forty-eight hours. If the patient survives for two days the prognosis is
 35676	favourable.
 35677	
 35678	_Treatment._--A broad ligature should be tied tightly round the limb
 35679	above the seat of infection, to prevent the poison passing into the
 35680	general circulation, and bleeding from the wound should be encouraged.
 35681	The application of an elastic bandage from above downward to empty the
 35682	blood out of the infected portion of the limb has been recommended. The
 35683	whole of the bite should at once be excised, and crystals of
 35684	permanganate of potash rubbed into the wound until it is black, or
 35685	peroxide of hydrogen applied with the object of destroying the poison by
 35686	oxidation.
 35687	
 35688	The general treatment consists in free stimulation with whisky, brandy,
 35689	ammonia, digitalis, etc. Hypodermic injections of strychnin in doses
 35690	sufficiently large to produce a slight degree of poisoning by the drug
 35691	are particularly useful. The most rational treatment, when it is
 35692	available, is the use of the _antivenin_ introduced by Fraser and
 35693	Calmette.

 35712	peritoneum, the intestine, the kidney, prostate and testis, and in the
 35713	skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue; it is seldom met with in the
 35714	breast or in muscles, and it rarely affects the ovary, the pancreas, the
 35715	parotid, or the thyreoid.
 35716	
 35717	_Tubercle bacilli_ vary widely in their virulence, and they are more
 35718	tenacious of life than the common pyogenic bacteria. In a dry state, for
 35719	example, they can retain their vitality for months; and they can also
 35720	survive immersion in water for prolonged periods. They resist the action
 35721	of the products of putrefaction for a considerable time, and are not
 35722	destroyed by digestive processes in the stomach and intestine. They may
 35723	be killed in a few minutes by boiling, or by exposure to steam under
 35724	pressure, or by immersion for less than a minute in 1 in 20 carbolic
 35725	lotion.
 35726	
 35727	#Methods of Infection.#--In marked contrast to what obtains in the
 35728	infective diseases that have already been described, tuberculosis rarely
 35729	results from the _infection of a wound_. In exceptional instances,
 35730	however, this does occur, and in illustration of the fact may be cited
 35731	the case of a servant who cut her finger with a broken spittoon
 35732	containing the sputum of her consumptive master; the wound subsequently
 35733	showed evidence of tuberculous infection, which ultimately spread up
 35734	along the lymph vessels of the arm. Pathologists, too, whose hands,
 35735	before the days of rubber gloves, were frequently exposed to the contact
 35736	of tuberculous tissues and pus, were liable to suffer from a form of
 35737	tuberculosis of the skin of the finger, known as _anatomical tubercle_.
 35738	Slight wounds of the feet in children who go about barefoot in towns
 35739	sometimes become infected with tubercle. Operation wounds made with
 35740	instruments contaminated with tuberculous material have also been known
 35741	to become infected. It is highly probable that the common form of
 35742	tuberculosis of the skin known as "lupus" arises by direct infection
 35743	from without.
 35744	
 35745	[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Tubercle Bacilli in caseous material

 35747	
 35748	In the vast majority of cases the tubercle bacillus gains entrance to
 35749	the body by way of the mucous surfaces, the organisms being either
 35750	inhaled or swallowed; those inhaled are mostly derived from the human
 35751	subject, those swallowed, from cattle. Bacilli, whether inhaled or
 35752	swallowed, are especially apt to lodge about the pharynx and pass to the
 35753	pharyngeal lymphoid tissue and tonsils, and by way of the lymph vessels
 35754	to the glands. The glands most frequently infected in this way are the
 35755	cervical glands, and those within the cavity of the chest--particularly
 35756	the bronchial glands at the root of the lung. From these, infection
 35757	extends at any later period in life to the bones, joints, and internal
 35758	organs.
 35759	
 35760	There is reason to believe that the organisms may lie in a dormant
 35761	condition for an indefinite period in these glands, and only become
 35762	active long afterwards, when some depression of the patient's health
 35763	produces conditions which favour their growth. When the organisms become
 35764	active in this way, the tuberculous tissue undergoes softening and
 35765	disintegration, and the infective material, by bursting into an adjacent
 35766	vein, may enter the blood-stream, in which it is carried to distant
 35767	parts of the body. In this way a _general tuberculosis_ may be set up,
 35768	or localised foci of tuberculosis may develop in the tissues in which
 35769	the organisms lodge. Many tuberculous patients are to be regarded as
 35770	possessing in their bronchial glands, or elsewhere, an internal store of
 35771	bacilli, to which the disease for which advice is sought owes its
 35772	origin, and from which similar outbreaks of tuberculosis may originate
 35773	in the future.
 35774	
 35775	_The alimentary mucous membrane_, especially that of the lower ileum and
 35776	caecum, is exposed to infection by swallowed sputum and by food
 35777	materials, such as milk, containing tubercle bacilli. The organisms may
 35778	lodge in the mucous membrane and cause tuberculous ulceration, or they
 35779	may be carried through the wall of the bowel into the lacteals, along
 35780	which they pass to the mesenteric glands where they become arrested and
 35781	give rise to tuberculous disease.
 35782	
 35783	#Relationship of Tuberculosis to Trauma.#--Any tissue whose vitality has
 35784	been lowered by injury or disease furnishes a favourable nidus for the
 35785	lodgment and growth of tubercle bacilli. The injury or disease, however,
 35786	is to be looked upon as determining the _localisation_ of the
 35787	tuberculous lesion rather than as an essential factor in its causation.
 35788	In a person, for example, in whose blood tubercle bacilli are
 35789	circulating and reaching every tissue and organ of the body, the
 35790	occurrence of tuberculous disease in a particular part may be determined
 35791	by the depression of the tissues resulting from an injury of that part.
 35792	There can be no doubt that excessive movement and jarring of a limb
 35793	aggravates tuberculous disease of a joint; also that an injury may light
 35794	up a focus that has been long quiescent, but we do not agree with
 35795	those--Da Costa, for example--who maintain that injury may be a
 35796	determining cause of tuberculosis. The question is not one of mere
 35797	academic interest, but one that may raise important issues in the law
 35798	courts.
 35799	
 35800	#Human and Bovine Tuberculosis.#--The frequency of the bovine bacillus
 35801	in the abdominal and in the glandular and osseous tuberculous lesions of
 35802	children would appear to justify the conclusion that the disease is
 35803	transmissible from the ox to the human subject, and that the milk of
 35804	tuberculous cows is probably a common vehicle of transmission.
 35805	
 35806	#Changes in the Tissues following upon the successful Lodgment of
 35807	Tubercle Bacilli.#--The action of the bacilli on the tissues results in
 35808	the formation of granulation tissue comprising characteristic tissue
 35809	elements and with a marked tendency to undergo caseation.
 35810	
 35811	The recognition of the characteristic elements, with or without
 35812	caseation, is usually sufficient evidence of the tuberculous nature of
 35813	any portion of tissue examined for diagnostic purposes. The recognition
 35814	of the bacillus itself by appropriate methods of staining makes the
 35815	diagnosis a certainty; but as it is by no means easy to identify the
 35816	organism in many forms of surgical tuberculosis, it may be necessary to
 35817	have recourse to experimental inoculation of susceptible animals such as
 35818	guinea-pigs.
 35819	
 35820	The changes subsequent to the formation of tuberculous granulation
 35821	tissue are liable to many variations. It must always be borne in mind
 35822	that although the bacilli have effected a lodgment and have inaugurated
 35823	disease, the relation between them and the tissues remains one of mutual
 35824	antagonism; which of them is to gain and keep the upper hand in the
 35825	conflict depends on their relative powers of resistance.
 35826	
 35827	If the tissues prevail, there ensues a process of repair. In the
 35828	immediate vicinity of the area of infection young connective tissue, and
 35829	later, fibrous tissue, is formed. This may replace the tuberculous
 35830	tissue and bring about repair--a fibrous cicatrix remaining to mark the
 35831	scene of the previous contest. Scars of this nature are frequently
 35832	discovered at the apex of the lung after death in persons who have at
 35833	one time suffered from pulmonary phthisis. Under other circumstances,
 35834	the tuberculous tissue that has undergone caseation, or even
 35835	calcification, is only encapsulated by the new fibrous tissue, like a
 35836	foreign body. Although this may be regarded as a victory for the
 35837	tissues, the cure, if such it may be called, is not necessarily a
 35838	permanent one, for at any subsequent period, if the part affected is
 35839	disturbed by injury or through some other influence, the encapsulated
 35840	tubercle may again become active and get the upper hand of the tissues,
 35841	and there results a relapse or recrudescence of the disease. This
 35842	_tendency to relapse_ after apparent cure is a notable feature of
 35843	tuberculous disease as it is met with in the spine, or in the
 35844	hip-joint, and it necessitates a prolonged course of treatment to give
 35845	the best chance of a lasting cure.
 35846	
 35847	If, however, at the inauguration of the tuberculous disease the bacilli
 35848	prevail, the infection tends to spread into the tissues surrounding
 35849	those originally infected, and more and more tuberculous granulation
 35850	tissue is formed. Finally the tuberculous tissue breaks down and
 35851	liquefies, resulting in the formation of a cold abscess. In their
 35852	struggle with the tissues, tubercle bacilli receive considerable support
 35853	and assistance from any pyogenic organisms that may be present. A
 35854	tuberculous infection may exhibit its aggressive qualities in a more
 35855	serious manner by sending off detachments of bacilli, which are carried
 35856	by the lymphatics to the nearest glands, or by the blood-stream to more
 35857	distant, and it may be to all, parts of the body. When the infection is
 35858	thus generalised, the condition is called _general tuberculosis_.
 35859	Considering the extraordinary frequency of localised forms of surgical
 35860	tuberculosis, general dissemination of the disease is rare.
 35861	
 35862	#The clinical features# of surgical tuberculosis will be described with
 35863	the individual tissues and organs, as they vary widely according to the
 35864	situation of the lesion.
 35865	
 35866	#The general treatment# consists in combating the adverse influences
 35867	that have been mentioned as increasing the liability to tuberculous
 35868	infection. Within recent years the value of the "open-air" treatment has
 35869	been widely recognised. An open-air life, even in the centre of a city,
 35870	may be followed by marked improvement, especially in the hospital class
 35871	of patient, whose home surroundings tend to favour the progress of the
 35872	disease. The purer air of places away from centres of population is
 35873	still better; and, according to the idiosyncrasies of the individual
 35874	patient, mountain air or that of the sea coast may be preferred. In view
 35875	of the possible discomforts and gastric disturbance which may attend a
 35876	sea-voyage, this should be recommended to patients suffering from
 35877	tuberculous lesions with more caution than has hitherto been exercised.
 35878	The diet must be a liberal one, and should include those articles which
 35879	are at the same time easily digested and nourishing, especially proteids
 35880	and fats; milk obtained from a reliable source and underdone
 35881	butcher-meat are among the best. When the ordinary nourishment taken is
 35882	insufficient, it may be supplemented by such articles as malt extract,
 35883	stout, and cod-liver oil. The last is specially beneficial in patients
 35884	who do not take enough fat in other forms. It is noteworthy that many
 35885	tuberculous patients show an aversion to fat.
 35886	
 35887	For _the use of tuberculin in diagnosis_ and for _the vaccine treatment
 35888	of tuberculosis_ the reader is referred to text-books on medicine.
 35889	
 35890	In addition to increasing the resisting power of the patient, it is
 35891	important to enable the fluids of the body, so altered, to come into
 35892	contact with the tuberculous focus. One of the obstacles to this is that
 35893	the focus is often surrounded by tissues or fluids which have been
 35894	almost entirely deprived of bactericidal substances. In the case of
 35895	caseated glands in the neck, for example, it is obvious that the removal
 35896	of this inert material is necessary before the tissues can be irrigated
 35897	with fluids of high bactericidal value. Again, in tuberculous ascites
 35898	the abdominal cavity is filled with a fluid practically devoid of
 35899	anti-bacterial substances, so that the bacilli are able to thrive and
 35900	work their will on the tissues. When the stagnant fluid is got rid of by
 35901	laparotomy, the parts are immediately douched with lymph charged with
 35902	protective substances, the bactericidal power of which may be many times
 35903	that of the fluid displaced.
 35904	
 35905	It is probable that the beneficial influence of _counter-irritants_,
 35906	such as blisters, and exposure to the _Finsen light_ and other forms of
 35907	_rays_, is to be attributed in part to the increased flow of blood to
 35908	the infected tissues.
 35909	
 35910	_Artificial Hyperaemia._--As has been explained, the induction of
 35911	hyperaemia by the method devised by Bier, constitutes one of our most
 35912	efficient means of combating bacterial infection. The treatment of
 35913	tuberculosis on this plan has been proved by experience to be a valuable
 35914	addition to our therapeutic measures, and the simplicity of its
 35915	application has led to its being widely adopted in practice. It results
 35916	in an increase in the reactive changes around the tuberculous focus, an
 35917	increase in the immigration of leucocytes, and infiltration with the
 35918	lymphocytes.
 35919	
 35920	The constricting bandage should be applied at some distance above the
 35921	seat of infection; for instance, in disease of the wrist, it is put on
 35922	above the elbow, and it must not cause pain either where it is applied
 35923	or in the diseased part. The bandage is only applied for a few hours
 35924	each day, either two hours at a time or twice a day for one hour, and,
 35925	while it is on, all dressings are removed save a piece of sterile gauze
 35926	over any wound or sinus that may be present. The process of cure takes a
 35927	long time--nine or even twelve months in the case of a severe joint
 35928	affection.
 35929	
 35930	In cases in which a constricting bandage is inapplicable, for example,
 35931	in cold abscesses, tuberculous glands or tendon sheaths, Klapp's suction
 35932	bell is employed. The cup is applied for five minutes at a time and then
 35933	taken off for three minutes, and this is repeated over a period of
 35934	about three-quarters of an hour. The pus is allowed to escape by a small
 35935	incision, and no packing or drain should be introduced.
 35936	
 35937	It has been found that tuberculous lesions tend to undergo cure
 35938	when the infected tissues are exposed to the rays of the
 35939	sun--_heliotherapy_--therefore whenever practicable this therapeutic
 35940	measure should be had recourse to.
 35941	
 35942	Since the introduction of the methods of treatment described above, and
 35943	especially by their employment at an early stage in the disease, the
 35944	number of cases of tuberculosis requiring operative interference has
 35945	greatly diminished. There are still circumstances, however, in which an
 35946	operation is required; for example, in disease of the lymph glands for
 35947	the removal of inert masses of caseous material, in disease of bone for
 35948	the removal of sequestra, or in disease of joints to improve the
 35949	function of the limb. It is to be understood, however, that operative
 35950	treatment must always be preceded by and combined with other therapeutic
 35951	measures.
 35952	
 35953	
 35954	TUBERCULOUS ABSCESS
 35955	
 35956	The caseation of tuberculous granulation tissue and its liquefaction is
 35957	a slow and insidious process, and is unattended with the classical signs
 35958	of inflammation--hence the terms "cold" and "chronic" applied to the
 35959	tuberculous abscess.
 35960	
 35961	In a cold abscess, such as that which results from tuberculous disease
 35962	of the vertebrae, the clinical appearances are those of a soft, fluid
 35963	swelling without heat, redness, pain, or fever. When toxic symptoms are
 35964	present, they are usually due to a mixed infection.
 35965	
 35966	A tuberculous abscess results from the disintegration and liquefaction
 35967	of tuberculous granulation tissue which has undergone caseation. Fluid
 35968	and cells from the adjacent blood vessels exude into the cavity, and
 35969	lead to variations in the character of its contents. In some cases the
 35970	contents consist of a clear amber-coloured fluid, in which are suspended
 35971	fragments of caseated tissue; in others, of a white material like
 35972	cream-cheese. From the addition of a sufficient number of leucocytes,
 35973	the contents may resemble the pus of an ordinary abscess.
 35974	
 35975	The wall of the abscess is lined with tuberculous granulation tissue,
 35976	the inner layers of which are undergoing caseation and disintegration,
 35977	and present a shreddy appearance; the outer layers consist of
 35978	tuberculous tissue which has not yet undergone caseation. The abscess
 35979	tends to increase in size by progressive liquefaction of the inner
 35980	layers, caseation of the outer layers, and the further invasion of the
 35981	surrounding tissues by tubercle bacilli. In this way a tuberculous
 35982	abscess is capable of indefinite extension and increase in size until it
 35983	reaches a free surface and ruptures externally. The direction in which
 35984	it spreads is influenced by the anatomical arrangement of the tissues,
 35985	and possibly to some extent by gravity, and the abscess may reach the
 35986	surface at a considerable distance from its seat of origin. The best
 35987	illustration of this is seen in the psoas abscess, which may originate
 35988	in the dorsal vertebrae, extend downwards within the sheath of the psoas
 35989	muscle, and finally appear in the thigh.
 35990	
 35991	#Clinical Features.#--The insidious development of the tuberculous
 35992	abscess is one of its characteristic features. The swelling may attain a
 35993	considerable size without the patient being aware of its existence, and,
 35994	as a matter of fact, it is often discovered accidentally. The absence of
 35995	toxaemia is to be associated with the incapacity of the wall of the
 35996	abscess to permit of absorption; this is shown also by the fact that
 35997	when even a large quantity of iodoform is inserted into the cavity of
 35998	the abscess, there are no symptoms of poisoning. The abscess varies in
 35999	size from a small cherry to a cavity containing several pints of pus.
 36000	Its shape also varies; it is usually that of a flattened sphere, but it
 36001	may present pockets or burrows running in various directions. Sometimes
 36002	it is hour-glass or dumb-bell shaped, as is well illustrated in the
 36003	region of the groin in disease of the spine or pelvis, where there may
 36004	be a large sac occupying the venter ilii, and a smaller one in the
 36005	thigh, the two communicating by a narrow channel under Poupart's
 36006	ligament. By pressing with the fingers the pus may be displaced from one
 36007	compartment to the other. The usual course of events is that the abscess
 36008	progresses slowly, and finally reaches a free surface--generally the
 36009	skin. As it does so there may be some pain, redness, and local elevation
 36010	of temperature. Fluctuation becomes evident and superficial, and the
 36011	skin becomes livid and finally gives way. If the case is left to nature,
 36012	the discharge of pus continues, and the track opening on the skin
 36013	remains as a _sinus_. The persistence of suppuration is due to the
 36014	presence in the wall of the abscess and of the sinus, of tuberculous
 36015	granulation tissue, which, so long as it remains, continues to furnish
 36016	discharge, and so prevents healing. Sooner or later pyogenic organisms
 36017	gain access to the sinus, and through it to the wall of the abscess.
 36018	They tend further to depress the resisting power of the tissues, and
 36019	thereby aggravate and perpetuate the tuberculous disease. This
 36020	superadded infection with pyogenic organisms exposes the patient to the
 36021	further risks of septic intoxication, especially in the form of hectic
 36022	fever and septicaemia, and increases the liability to general
 36023	tuberculosis, and to waxy degeneration of the internal organs. The mixed
 36024	infection is chiefly responsible for the pyrexia, sweating, and
 36025	emaciation which the laity associate with consumptive disease. A
 36026	tuberculous abscess may in one or other of these ways be a cause of
 36027	death.
 36028	
 36029	_Residual abscess_ is the name given to an abscess that makes its
 36030	appearance months, or even years, after the apparent cure of tuberculous
 36031	disease--as, for example, in the hip-joint or spine. It is called
 36032	residual because it has its origin in the remains of the original
 36033	disease.
 36034	
 36035	[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Tuberculous Abscess in right lumbar region in a
 36036	woman aged thirty.]
 36037	
 36038	#Diagnosis.#--A cold abscess is to be diagnosed from a syphilitic gumma,
 36039	a cyst, and from lipoma and other soft tumours. The differential
 36040	diagnosis of these affections will be considered later; it is often made
 36041	easier by recognising the presence of a lesion that is likely to cause a
 36042	cold abscess, such as tuberculous disease of the spine or of the
 36043	sacro-iliac joint. When it is about to burst externally, it may be
 36044	difficult to distinguish a tuberculous abscess from one due to infection
 36045	with pyogenic organisms. Even when the abscess is opened, the
 36046	appearances of the pus may not supply the desired information, and it
 36047	may be necessary to submit it to bacteriological examination. When the
 36048	pus is found to be sterile, it is usually safe to assume that the
 36049	condition is tuberculous, as in other forms of suppuration the causative
 36050	organisms can usually be recognised. Experimental inoculation will
 36051	establish a definite diagnosis, but it implies a delay of two to three
 36052	weeks.
 36053	
 36054	#Treatment.#--The tuberculous abscess may recede and disappear under
 36055	general treatment. Many surgeons advise that so long as the abscess is
 36056	quiescent it should be left alone. All agree, however, that if it shows
 36057	a tendency to spread, to increase in size, or to approach the skin or a
 36058	mucous membrane, something should be done to avoid the danger of its
 36059	bursting and becoming infected with pyogenic organisms. Simple
 36060	evacuation of the abscess by a hollow needle may suffice, or bismuth or
 36061	iodoform may be introduced after withdrawal of the contents.
 36062	
 36063	_Evacuation of the Abscess and Injection of Iodoform._--The iodoform is
 36064	employed in the form of a 10 per cent. solution in ether or the same
 36065	proportion suspended in glycerin. Either form becomes sterile soon after
 36066	it is prepared. Its curative effects would appear to depend upon the
 36067	liberation of iodine, which restrains the activity of the bacilli, and
 36068	upon its capacity for irritating the tissues and so inducing a
 36069	protective leucocytosis, and also of stimulating the formation of scar
 36070	tissue. An anaesthetic is rarely called for, except in children. The
 36071	abscess is first evacuated by means of a large trocar and cannula
 36072	introduced obliquely through the overlying soft parts, avoiding any part
 36073	where the skin is thin or red. If the cannula becomes blocked with
 36074	caseous material, it may be cleared with a probe, or a small quantity of
 36075	saline solution is forced in by the syringe. The iodoform is injected by
 36076	means of a glass-barrelled syringe, which is firmly screwed on to the
 36077	cannula. The amount injected varies with the size of the abscess and the
 36078	age of the patient; it may be said to range from two or three drams in
 36079	the case of children to several ounces in large abscesses in adults. The
 36080	cannula is withdrawn, the puncture is closed by a Michel's clip, and a
 36081	dressing applied so as to exert a certain amount of compression. If the
 36082	abscess fills up again, the procedure should be repeated; in doing so,
 36083	the contents show the coloration due to liberated iodine. When the
 36084	contents are semi-solid, and cannot be withdrawn even through a large
 36085	cannula, an incision must be made, and, after the cavity has been
 36086	emptied, the iodoform is introduced through a short rubber tube attached
 36087	to the syringe. Experience has shown that even large abscesses, such as
 36088	those associated with spinal disease, may be cured by iodoform
 36089	injection, and this even when rupture of the abscess on the skin surface
 36090	has appeared to be imminent.
 36091	
 36092	Another method of treatment which is less popular now than it used to
 36093	be, and which is chiefly applicable in abscesses of moderate size, is by
 36094	_incision of the abscess and removal of the tuberculous tissue in its
 36095	wall_ with the sharp spoon. An incision is made which will give free
 36096	access to the interior of the abscess, so that outlying pockets or
 36097	recesses may not be overlooked. After removal of the pus, the wall of
 36098	the abscess is scraped with the Volkmann spoon or with Barker's flushing
 36099	spoon, to get rid of the tuberculous tissue with which it is lined. In
 36100	using the spoon, care must be taken that its sharp edge does not
 36101	perforate the wall of a vein or other important structure. Any debris
 36102	which may adhere to the walls is removed by rubbing with dry gauze. The
 36103	oozing of blood is arrested by packing the cavity for a few minutes with
 36104	gauze. After the packing is removed, iodoform powder is rubbed into the
 36105	raw surface. The soft parts divided by the incision are sutured in
 36106	layers so as to ensure primary union. If, on the other hand, there is
 36107	fear of a mixed infection, especially in abscesses near the rectum or
 36108	anus, it is safer to treat it by the open method, packing the cavity
 36109	with iodoform worsted or bismuth gauze, which is renewed at intervals of
 36110	a week or ten days as the cavity heals from the bottom.
 36111	
 36112	Another method is to incise the abscess, cleanse the cavity with gauze,
 36113	irrigate with Carrel-Dakin solution and pack with gauze smeared with the
 36114	dilute non-toxic B.I.P.P. (bismuth and iodoform 2 parts, vaseline 12
 36115	parts, hard paraffin, sufficient to give the consistence of butter). The
 36116	wound is closed with "bipped" silk sutures; one of these--the "waiting
 36117	suture"--is left loose to permit of withdrawal of the gauze after
 36118	forty-eight hours; the waiting suture is then tied, and delayed primary
 36119	union is thus effected.
 36120	
 36121	When the skin over the abscess is red, thin, and about to give way, as
 36122	is frequently the case when the abscess is situated in the subcutaneous
 36123	cellular tissue, any skin which is undermined and infected with tubercle
 36124	should be removed with the scissors at the same time that the abscess is
 36125	dealt with.
 36126	
 36127	In abscesses treated by the open method, when the cavity has become
 36128	lined with healthy granulations, it may be closed by secondary suture,
 36129	or, if the granulating surface is flush with the skin, healing may be
 36130	hastened by skin-grafting.
 36131	
 36132	If the tuberculous abscess has burst and left a _sinus_, this is apt to
 36133	persist because of the presence of tuberculous tissue in its wall, and
 36134	of superadded pyogenic infection, or because it serves as an avenue for
 36135	the escape of discharge from a focus of tubercle in a bone or a lymph
 36136	gland.
 36137	
 36138	[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Tuberculous Sinus injected through its opening
 36139	in the forearm with bismuth paste.
 36140	
 36141	(Mr. Pirie Watson's case--Radiogram by Dr. Hope Fowler.)]
 36142	
 36143	The treatment varies with the conditions present, and must include
 36144	measures directed to the lesion from which the sinus has originated. The
 36145	extent and direction of any given sinus may be demonstrated by the use
 36146	of the probe, or, more accurately, by injecting the sinus with a paste
 36147	consisting of white vaseline containing 10 to 30 per cent. of bismuth
 36148	subcarbonate, and following its track with the X-rays (Fig. 35).
 36149	
 36150	It was found by Beck of Chicago that the injection of bismuth paste is
 36151	frequently followed by healing of the sinus, and that, if one injection
 36152	fails to bring about a cure, repeating the injection every second day
 36153	may be successful. Some caution must be observed in this treatment, as
 36154	symptoms of poisoning have been observed to follow its use. If they
 36155	manifest themselves, an injection of warm olive oil should be given; the
 36156	oil, left in for twelve hours or so, forms an emulsion with the bismuth,
 36157	which can be withdrawn by aspiration. Iodoform suspended in glycerin may
 36158	be employed in a similar manner. When these and other non-operative
 36159	measures fail, and the whole track of the sinus is accessible, it should
 36160	be laid open, scraped, and packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze until
 36161	it heals from the bottom.

 36184	
 36185	Syphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a
 36186	specific virus. It is nearly always communicated from one individual to
 36187	another by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion
 36188	being the medium through which the virus is transmitted, and the seat of
 36189	inoculation is almost invariably a surface covered by squamous
 36190	epithelium. The disease was unknown in Europe before the year 1493, when
 36191	it was introduced into Spain by Columbus' crew, who were infected in
 36192	Haiti, where the disease had been endemic from time immemorial (Bloch).
 36193	
 36194	The granulation tissue which forms as a result of the reaction of the
 36195	tissues to the presence of the virus is chiefly composed of lymphocytes
 36196	and plasma cells, along with an abundant new formation of capillary
 36197	blood vessels. Giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells,
 36198	which are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are
 36199	practically absent.
 36200	
 36201	When syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact
 36202	infection, the condition is spoken of as _acquired syphilis_, and the
 36203	first visible sign of the disease appears at the site of inoculation,
 36204	and is known as _the primary lesion_. Those who have thus acquired the
 36205	disease may transmit it to their offspring, who are then said to suffer
 36206	from _inherited syphilis_.
 36207	
 36208	#The Virus of Syphilis.#--The cause of syphilis, whether acquired or
 36209	inherited, is the organism, described by Schaudinn and Hoffman, in 1905,
 36210	under the name of _spirochaeta pallida_ or _spironema pallidum_. It is a
 36211	delicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 u and
 36212	in width about 0.25 u, and is distinguished from other spirochaetes by
 36213	its delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely
 36214	twisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are
 36215	perfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same
 36216	during rest and in active movement (Fig. 36). In a fresh specimen, such
 36217	as a scraping from a hard chancre suspended in a little salt solution,
 36218	it shows active movements. The organism is readily destroyed by heat,
 36219	and perishes in the absence of moisture. It has been proved
 36220	experimentally that it remains infective only up to six hours after its
 36221	removal from the body. Noguchi has succeeded in obtaining pure cultures
 36222	from the infected tissues of the rabbit.
 36223	
 36224	[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Spirochaeta pallida from scraping of hard
 36225	Chancre of Prepuce. x 1000 diam. Burri method.]
 36226	
 36227	The spirochaete may be recognised in films made by scraping the deeper
 36228	parts of the primary lesion, from papules on the skin, or from blisters
 36229	artificially raised on lesions of the skin or on the immediately
 36230	adjacent portion of healthy skin. It is readily found in the mucous
 36231	patches and condylomata of the secondary period. It is best stained by
 36232	Giemsa's method, and its recognition is greatly aided by the use of the
 36233	ultra-microscope.
 36234	
 36235	The spirochaete has been demonstrated in every form of syphilitic lesion,
 36236	and has been isolated from the blood--with difficulty--and from lymph
 36237	withdrawn by a hollow needle from enlarged lymph glands. The saliva of
 36238	persons suffering from syphilitic lesions of the mouth also contains the
 36239	organism.
 36240	
 36241	[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Spirochaeta refrigerans from scraping of Vagina.
 36242	x 1000 diam. Burri method.]
 36243	
 36244	In tertiary lesions there is greater difficulty in demonstrating the
 36245	spirochaete, but small numbers have been found in the peripheral parts of
 36246	gummata and in the thickened patches in syphilitic disease of the aorta.
 36247	Noguchi and Moore have discovered the spirochaete in the brain in a
 36248	number of cases of general paralysis of the insane. The spirochaete may
 36249	persist in the body for a long time after infection; its presence has
 36250	been demonstrated as long as sixteen years after the original
 36251	acquisition of the disease.
 36252	
 36253	In inherited syphilis the spirochaete is present in enormous numbers
 36254	throughout all the organs and fluids of the body.
 36255	
 36256	Considerable interest attaches to the observations of Metchnikoff, Roux,
 36257	and Neisser, who have succeeded in conveying syphilis to the chimpanzee
 36258	and other members of the ape tribe, obtaining primary and secondary
 36259	lesions similar to those observed in man, and also containing the
 36260	spirochaete. In animals the disease has been transmitted by material from
 36261	all kinds of syphilitic lesions, including even the blood in the
 36262	secondary and tertiary stages of the disease. The primary lesion is in
 36263	the form of an indurated papule, in every respect resembling the
 36264	corresponding lesion in man, and associated with enlargement and
 36265	induration of the lymph glands. The primary lesion usually appears about
 36266	thirty days after inoculation, to be followed, in about half the cases,
 36267	by secondary manifestations, which are usually of a mild character; in
 36268	no instance has any tertiary lesion been observed. The severity of the
 36269	affection amongst apes would appear to be in proportion to the nearness
 36270	of the relationship of the animal to the human subject. The eye of the
 36271	rabbit is also susceptible to inoculation from syphilitic lesions; the
 36272	material in a finely divided state is introduced into the anterior
 36273	chamber of the eye.
 36274	
 36275	Attempts to immunise against the disease have so far proved negative,
 36276	but Metchnikoff has shown that the inunction of the part inoculated with
 36277	an ointment containing 33 per cent. of calomel, within one hour of
 36278	infection, suffices to neutralise the virus in man, and up to eighteen
 36279	hours in monkeys. He recommends the adoption of this procedure in the
 36280	prophylaxis of syphilis.
 36281	
 36282	Noguchi has made an emulsion of dead spirochaetes which he calls
 36283	_luetin_, and which gives a specific reaction resembling that of
 36284	tuberculin in tuberculosis, a papule or a pustule forming at the site of
 36285	the intra-dermal injection. It is said to be most efficacious in the
 36286	tertiary and latent forms of syphilis, which are precisely those forms
 36287	in which the diagnosis is surrounded with difficulties.
 36288	
 36289	
 36290	ACQUIRED SYPHILIS
 36291	
 36292	In the vast majority of cases, infection takes place during the congress
 36293	of the sexes. Delicate, easily abraded surfaces are then brought into
 36294	contact, and the discharge from lesions containing the virus is placed
 36295	under favourable conditions for conveying the disease from one person to
 36296	the other. In the male the possibility of infection taking place is
 36297	increased if the virus is retained under cover of a long and tight
 36298	prepuce, and if there are abrasions on the surface with which it comes
 36299	in contact. The frequency with which infection takes place on the
 36300	genitals during sexual intercourse warrants syphilis being considered a
 36301	venereal disease, although there are other ways in which it may be
 36302	contracted.
 36303	
 36304	Some of these imply direct contact--such, for example, as kissing, the
 36305	digital examination of syphilitic patients by doctors or nurses, or
 36306	infection of the surgeon's fingers while operating upon a syphilitic
 36307	patient. In suckling, a syphilitic wet nurse may infect a healthy
 36308	infant, or a syphilitic infant may infect a healthy wet nurse. In other
 36309	cases the infection is by indirect contact, the virus being conveyed
 36310	through the medium of articles contaminated by a syphilitic
 36311	patient--such, for example, as surgical instruments, tobacco pipes, wind
 36312	instruments, table utensils, towels, or underclothing. Physiological
 36313	secretions, such as saliva, milk, or tears, are not capable of
 36314	communicating the disease unless contaminated by discharge from a
 36315	syphilitic sore. While the saliva itself is innocuous, it can be, and
 36316	often is, contaminated by the discharge from mucous patches or other
 36317	syphilitic lesions in the mouth and throat, and is then a dangerous
 36318	medium of infection. Unless these extra-genital sources of infection are
 36319	borne in mind, there is a danger of failing to recognise the primary
 36320	lesion of syphilis in unusual positions, such as the lip, finger, or
 36321	nipple. When the disease is thus acquired by innocent transfer, it is
 36322	known as _syphilis insontium_.
 36323	
 36324	#Stages or Periods of Syphilis.#--Following the teaching of Ricord, it
 36325	is customary to divide the life-history of syphilis into three periods
 36326	or stages, referred to, for convenience, as primary, secondary, and
 36327	tertiary. This division is to some extent arbitrary and artificial, as
 36328	the different stages overlap one another, and the lesions of one stage
 36329	merge insensibly into those of another. Wide variations are met with in
 36330	the manifestations of the secondary stage, and histologically there is
 36331	no valid distinction to be drawn between secondary and tertiary lesions.
 36332	
 36333	_The primary period_ embraces the interval that elapses between the
 36334	initial infection and the first constitutional manifestations,--roughly,
 36335	from four to eight weeks,--and includes the period of incubation, the
 36336	development of the primary sore, and the enlargement of the nearest
 36337	lymph glands.
 36338	
 36339	_The secondary period_ varies in duration from one to two years, during
 36340	which time the patient is liable to suffer from manifestations which are
 36341	for the most part superficial in character, affecting the skin and its
 36342	appendages, the mucous membranes, and the lymph glands.
 36343	
 36344	_The tertiary period_ has no time-limit except that it follows upon the
 36345	secondary, so that during the remainder of his life the patient is
 36346	liable to suffer from manifestations which may affect the deeper tissues
 36347	and internal organs as well as the skin and mucous membranes.
 36348	
 36349	#Primary Syphilis.#--_The period of incubation_ represents the interval
 36350	that elapses between the occurrence of infection and the appearance of
 36351	the primary lesion at the site of inoculation. Its limits may be stated
 36352	as varying from two to six weeks, with an average of from twenty-one to
 36353	twenty-eight days. While the disease is incubating, there is nothing to
 36354	show that infection has occurred.
 36355	
 36356	_The Primary Lesion._--The incubation period having elapsed, there
 36357	appears at the site of inoculation a circumscribed area of infiltration
 36358	which represents the reaction of the tissues to the entrance of the
 36359	virus. The first appearance is that of a sharply defined papule, rarely
 36360	larger than a split pea. Its surface is at first smooth and shiny, but
 36361	as necrosis of the tissue elements takes place in the centre, it becomes
 36362	concave, and in many cases the epithelium is shed, and an ulcer is
 36363	formed. Such an ulcer has an elevated border, sharply cut edges, an
 36364	indurated base, and exudes a scanty serous discharge; its surface is at
 36365	first occupied by yellow necrosed tissue, but in time this is replaced
 36366	by smooth, pale-pink granulation tissue; finally, epithelium may spread
 36367	over the surface, and the ulcer heals. As a rule, the patient suffers
 36368	little discomfort, and may even be ignorant of the existence of the
 36369	lesion, unless, as a result of exposure to mechanical or septic
 36370	irritation, ulceration ensues, and the sore becomes painful and tender,
 36371	and yields a purulent discharge. The primary lesion may persist until
 36372	the secondary manifestations make their appearance, that is, for several
 36373	weeks.
 36374	
 36375	It cannot be emphasised too strongly that the induration of the primary
 36376	lesion, which has obtained for it the name of "hard chancre," is its
 36377	most important characteristic. It is best appreciated when the sore is
 36378	grasped from side to side between the finger and thumb. The sensation on
 36379	grasping it has been aptly compared to that imparted by a nodule of
 36380	cartilage, or by a button felt through a layer of cloth. The evidence
 36381	obtained by touch is more valuable than that obtained by inspection, a
 36382	fact which is made use of in the recognition of _concealed
 36383	chancres_--that is, those which are hidden by a tight prepuce. The
 36384	induration is due not only to the dense packing of the connective-tissue
 36385	spaces with lymphocytes and plasma cells, but also to the formation of
 36386	new connective-tissue elements. It is most marked in chancres situated
 36387	in the furrow between the glans and the prepuce.
 36388	
 36389	_In the male_, the primary lesion specially affects certain
 36390	_situations_, and the appearances vary with these: (1) On the inner
 36391	aspect of the prepuce, and in the fold between the prepuce and the
 36392	glans; in the latter situation the induration imparts a "collar-like"
 36393	rigidity to the prepuce, which is most apparent when it is rolled back
 36394	over the corona. (2) At the orifice of the prepuce the primary lesion
 36395	assumes the form of multiple linear ulcers or fissures, and as each of
 36396	these is attended with infiltration, the prepuce cannot be pulled
 36397	back--a condition known as _syphilitic phimosis_. (3) On the glans penis
 36398	the infiltration may be so superficial that it resembles a layer of
 36399	parchment, but if it invades the cavernous tissue there is a dense mass
 36400	of induration. (4) On the external aspect of the prepuce or on the skin
 36401	of the penis itself. (5) At either end of the torn fraenum, in the form
 36402	of a diamond-shaped ulcer raised above the surroundings. (6) In relation
 36403	to the meatus and canal of the urethra, in either of which situations
 36404	the swelling and induration may lead to narrowing of the urethra, so
 36405	that the urine is passed with pain and difficulty and in a minute
 36406	stream; stricture results only in the exceptional cases in which the
 36407	chancre has ulcerated and caused destruction of tissue. A chancre within
 36408	the orifice of the urethra is rare, and, being concealed from view, it
 36409	can only be recognised by the discharge from the meatus and by the
 36410	induration felt between the finger and thumb on palpating the urethra.
 36411	
 36412	_In the female_, the primary lesion is not so typical or so easily
 36413	recognised as in men; it is usually met with on the labia; the
 36414	induration is rarely characteristic and does not last so long. The
 36415	primary lesion may take the form of condylomata. Indurated oedema, with
 36416	brownish-red or livid discoloration of one or both labia, is diagnostic
 36417	of syphilis.
 36418	
 36419	The hard chancre is usually solitary, but sometimes there are two or
 36420	more; when there are several, they are individually smaller than the
 36421	solitary chancre.
 36422	
 36423	It is the exception for a hard chancre to leave a visible scar, hence,
 36424	in examining patients with a doubtful history of syphilis, little
 36425	reliance can be placed on the presence or absence of a scar on the
 36426	genitals. When the primary lesion has taken the form of an open ulcer
 36427	with purulent discharge, or has sloughed, there is a permanent scar.
 36428	
 36429	_Infection of the adjacent lymph glands_ is usually found to have taken
 36430	place by the time the primary lesion has acquired its characteristic
 36431	induration. Several of the glands along Poupart's ligament, on one or on
 36432	both sides, become enlarged, rounded, and indurated; they are usually
 36433	freely movable, and are rarely sensitive unless there is superadded
 36434	septic infection. The term _bullet-bubo_ has been applied to them, and
 36435	their presence is of great value in diagnosis. In a certain number of
 36436	cases, one of the main _lymph vessels_ on the dorsum of the penis is
 36437	transformed into a fibrous cord easily recognisable on palpation, and
 36438	when grasped between the fingers appears to be in size and consistence
 36439	not unlike the vas deferens.
 36440	
 36441	_Concealed chancre_ is the term applied when one or more chancres are
 36442	situated within the sac of a prepuce which cannot be retracted. If the
 36443	induration is well marked, the chancre can be palpated through the
 36444	prepuce, and is tender on pressure. As under these conditions it is
 36445	impossible for the patient to keep the parts clean, septic infection
 36446	becomes a prominent feature, the prepuce is oedematous and inflamed, and
 36447	there is an abundant discharge of pus from its orifice. It occasionally
 36448	happens that the infection assumes a virulent character and causes
 36449	sloughing of the prepuce--a condition known as _phagedaena_. The
 36450	discharge is then foul and blood-stained, and the prepuce becomes of a
 36451	dusky red or purple colour, and may finally slough, exposing the glans.
 36452	
 36453	_Extra-genital or Erratic Chancres_ (Fig. 38).--Erratic chancre is the
 36454	term applied by Jonathan Hutchinson to the primary lesion of syphilis
 36455	when it appears on parts of the body other than the genitals. It differs
 36456	in some respects from the hard chancre as met with on the penis; it is
 36457	usually larger, the induration is more diffused, and the enlarged glands
 36458	are softer and more sensitive. The glands in nearest relation to the
 36459	sore are those first affected, for example, the epitrochlear or axillary
 36460	glands in chancre of the finger; the submaxillary glands in chancre of
 36461	the lip or mouth; or the pre-auricular gland in chancre of the eyelid or
 36462	forehead. In consequence of their divergence from the typical chancre,
 36463	and of their being often met with in persons who, from age,
 36464	surroundings, or moral character, are unlikely subjects of venereal
 36465	disease, the true nature of erratic chancres is often overlooked until
 36466	the persistence of the lesion, its want of resemblance to anything else,
 36467	or the onset of constitutional symptoms, determines the diagnosis of
 36468	syphilis. A solitary, indolent sore occurring on the lip, eyelid,
 36469	finger, or nipple, which does not heal but tends to increase in size,
 36470	and is associated with induration and enlargement of the adjacent
 36471	glands, is most likely to be the primary lesion of syphilis.

 36478	
 36479	#The Soft Sore, Soft Chancre, or Chancroid.#--The differential diagnosis
 36480	of syphilis necessitates the consideration of the _soft sore_, _soft
 36481	chancre_, or _chancroid_, which is also a common form of venereal
 36482	disease, and is due to infection with a virulent pus-forming bacillus,
 36483	first described by Ducrey in 1889. Ducrey's bacillus occurs in the form
 36484	of minute oval rods measuring about 1.5 u in length, which stain readily
 36485	with any basic aniline dye, but are quickly decolorised by Gram's
 36486	method. They are found mixed with other organisms in the purulent
 36487	discharge from the sore, and are chiefly arranged in small groups or in
 36488	short chains. Soft sores are always contracted by direct contact from
 36489	another individual, and the incubation period is a short one of from two
 36490	to five days. They are usually situated in the vicinity of the fraenum,
 36491	and, in women, about the labia minora or fourchette; they probably
 36492	originate in abrasions in these situations. They appear as pustules,
 36493	which are rapidly converted into small, acutely inflamed ulcers with
 36494	sharply cut, irregular margins, which bleed easily and yield an abundant
 36495	yellow purulent discharge. They are devoid of the induration of
 36496	syphilis, are painful, and nearly always multiple, reproducing
 36497	themselves in successive crops by auto-inoculation. Soft sores are often
 36498	complicated by phimosis and balanitis, and they frequently lead to
 36499	infection of the glands in the groin. The resulting bubo is ill-defined,
 36500	painful, and tender, and suppuration occurs in about one-fourth of the
 36501	cases. The overlying skin becomes adherent and red, and suppuration
 36502	takes place either in the form of separate foci in the interior of the
 36503	individual glands, or around them; in the latter case, on incision, the
 36504	glands are found lying bathed in pus. Ducrey's bacillus is found in pure
 36505	culture in the pus. Sometimes other pyogenic organisms are superadded.
 36506	After the bubo has been opened the wound may take on the characters of a
 36507	soft sore.
 36508	
 36509	_Treatment._--Soft sores heal rapidly when kept clean. If concealed
 36510	under a tight prepuce, an incision should be made along the dorsum to
 36511	give access to the sores. They should be washed with eusol, and dusted
 36512	with a mixture of one part iodoform and two parts boracic or salicylic
 36513	acid, or, when the odour of iodoform is objected to, of equal parts of
 36514	boracic acid and carbonate of zinc. Immersion of the penis in a bath of
 36515	eusol for some hours daily is useful. The sore is then covered with a
 36516	piece of gauze kept in position by drawing the prepuce over it, or by a
 36517	few turns of a narrow bandage. Sublimed sulphur frequently rubbed into
 36518	the sore is recommended by C. H. Mills. If the sores spread in spite of
 36519	this, they should be painted with cocaine and then cauterised. When the
 36520	glands in the groin are infected, the patient must be confined to bed,
 36521	and a dressing impregnated with ichthyol and glycerin (10 per cent.)
 36522	applied; the repeated use of a suction bell is of great service.
 36523	Harrison recommends aspiration of a bubonic abscess, followed by
 36524	injection of 1 in 20 solution of tincture of iodine into the cavity;
 36525	this is in turn aspirated, and then 1 or 2 c.c. of the solution injected
 36526	and left in. This is repeated as often as the cavity refills. It is
 36527	sometimes necessary to let the pus out by one or more small incisions
 36528	and continue the use of the suction bell.
 36529	
 36530	_Diagnosis of Primary Syphilis._--In cases in which there is a history
 36531	of an incubation period of from three to five weeks, when the sore is
 36532	indurated, persistent, and indolent, and attended with bullet-buboes in
 36533	the groin, the diagnosis of primary syphilis is not difficult. Owing,
 36534	however, to the great importance of instituting treatment at the
 36535	earliest possible stage of the infection, an effort should be made to
 36536	establish the diagnosis without delay by demonstrating the spirochaete.
 36537	Before any antiseptic is applied, the margin of the suspected sore is
 36538	rubbed with gauze, and the serum that exudes on pressure is collected
 36539	in a capillary tube and sent to a pathologist for microscopical
 36540	examination. A better specimen can sometimes be obtained by puncturing
 36541	an enlarged lymph gland with a hypodermic needle, injecting a few minims
 36542	of sterile saline solution and then aspirating the blood-stained fluid.
 36543	
 36544	The Wassermann test must not be relied upon for diagnosis in the early
 36545	stage, as it does not appear until the disease has become generalised
 36546	and the secondary manifestations are about to begin. The practice of
 36547	waiting in doubtful cases before making a diagnosis until secondary
 36548	manifestations appear is to be condemned.
 36549	
 36550	Extra-genital chancres, _e.g._ sores on the fingers of doctors or
 36551	nurses, are specially liable to be overlooked, if the possibility of
 36552	syphilis is not kept in mind.
 36553	
 36554	It is important to bear in mind _the possibility of a patient having
 36555	acquired a mixed infection_ with the virus of soft chancre, which will
 36556	manifest itself a few days after infection, and the virus of syphilis,
 36557	which shows itself after an interval of several weeks. This occurrence
 36558	was formerly the source of much confusion in diagnosis, and it was
 36559	believed at one time that syphilis might result from soft sores, but it
 36560	is now established that syphilis does not follow upon soft sores unless
 36561	the virus of syphilis has been introduced at the same time. The
 36562	practitioner must be on his guard, therefore, when a patient asks his
 36563	advice concerning a venereal sore which has appeared within a few days
 36564	of exposure to infection. Such a patient is naturally anxious to know
 36565	whether he has contracted syphilis or not, but neither a positive nor a
 36566	negative answer can be given--unless the spirochaete can be identified.
 36567	
 36568	Syphilis is also to be diagnosed from _epithelioma_, the common form of
 36569	cancer of the penis. It is especially in elderly patients with a tight
 36570	prepuce that the induration of syphilis is liable to be mistaken for
 36571	that associated with epithelioma. In difficult cases the prepuce must be
 36572	slit open.
 36573	
 36574	Difficulty may occur in the diagnosis of primary syphilis from _herpes_,
 36575	as this may appear as late as ten days after connection; it commences as
 36576	a group of vesicles which soon burst and leave shallow ulcers with a
 36577	yellow floor; these disappear quickly on the use of an antiseptic
 36578	dusting powder.
 36579	
 36580	Apprehensive patients who have committed sexual indiscretions are apt to
 36581	regard as syphilitic any lesion which happens to be located on the
 36582	penis--for example, acne pustules, eczema, psoriasis papules, boils,
 36583	balanitis, or venereal warts.
 36584	
 36585	_The local treatment_ of the primary sore consists in attempting to
 36586	destroy the organisms _in situ_. An ointment made up of calomel 33
 36587	parts, lanoline 67 parts, and vaseline 10 parts (Metchnikoff's cream) is
 36588	rubbed into the sore several times a day. If the surface is unbroken, it
 36589	may be dusted lightly with a powder composed of equal parts of calomel
 36590	and carbonate of zinc. A gauze dressing is applied, and the penis and
 36591	scrotum should be supported against the abdominal wall by a triangular
 36592	handkerchief or bathing-drawers; if there is inflammatory oedema the
 36593	patient should be confined to bed.
 36594	
 36595	In _concealed chancres_ with phimosis, the sac of the prepuce should be
 36596	slit up along the dorsum to admit of the ointment being applied. If
 36597	phagedaena occurs, the prepuce must be slit open along the dorsum, or if
 36598	sloughing, cut away, and the patient should have frequent sitz baths of
 36599	weak sublimate lotion. When the chancre is within the meatus, iodoform
 36600	bougies are inserted into the urethra, and the urine should be rendered
 36601	bland by drinking large quantities of fluid.
 36602	
 36603	General treatment is considered on p. 149.
 36604	
 36605	#Secondary Syphilis.#--The following description of secondary syphilis
 36606	is based on the average course of the disease in untreated cases. The
 36607	onset of constitutional symptoms occurs from six to twelve weeks after
 36608	infection, and the manifestations are the result of the entrance of the
 36609	virus into the general circulation, and its being carried to all parts
 36610	of the body. The period during which the patient is liable to suffer
 36611	from secondary symptoms ranges from six months to two years.
 36612	
 36613	In some cases the general health is not disturbed; in others the patient
 36614	is feverish and out of sorts, losing appetite, becoming pale and anaemic,
 36615	complaining of lassitude, incapacity for exertion, headache, and pains
 36616	of a rheumatic type referred to the bones. There is a moderate degree of
 36617	leucocytosis, but the increase is due not to the polymorpho-nuclear
 36618	leucocytes but to lymphocytes. In isolated cases the temperature rises
 36619	to 101 o or 102 o F. and the patient loses flesh. The lymph glands,
 36620	particularly those along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid,
 36621	become enlarged and slightly tender. The hair comes out, eruptions
 36622	appear on the skin and mucous membranes, and the patient may suffer from
 36623	sore throat and affections of the eyes. The local lesions are to be
 36624	regarded as being of the nature of reactions against accumulations of
 36625	the parasite, lymphocytes and plasma cells being the elements chiefly
 36626	concerned in the reactive process.
 36627	
 36628	_Affections of the Skin_ are among the most constant manifestations. An
 36629	evanescent macular rash, not unlike that of measles--_roseola_--is the
 36630	first to appear, usually in from six to eight weeks from the date of
 36631	infection; it is widely diffused over the trunk, and the original dull
 36632	rose-colour soon fades, leaving brownish stains, which in time
 36633	disappear. It is usually followed by a _papular eruption_, the
 36634	individual papules being raised above the surface of the skin, smooth or
 36635	scaly, and as they are due to infiltration of the skin they are more
 36636	persistent than the roseoles. They vary in size and distribution, being
 36637	sometimes small, hard, polished, and closely aggregated like lichen,
 36638	sometimes as large as a shilling-piece, with an accumulation of scales
 36639	on the surface like that seen in psoriasis. The co-existence of scaly
 36640	papules and faded roseoles is very suggestive of syphilis.
 36641	
 36642	Other types of eruption are less common, and are met with from the third
 36643	month onwards. A _pustular_ eruption, not unlike that of acne, is
 36644	sometimes a prominent feature, but is not characteristic of syphilis
 36645	unless it affects the scalp and forehead and is associated with the
 36646	remains of the papular eruption. The term _ecthyma_ is applied when the
 36647	pustules are of large size, and, after breaking on the surface, give
 36648	rise to superficial ulcers; the discharge from the ulcer often dries up
 36649	and forms a scab or crust which is continually added to from below as
 36650	the ulcer extends in area and depth. The term _rupia_ is applied when
 36651	the crusts are prominent, dark in colour, and conical in shape, roughly
 36652	resembling the shell of a limpet. If the crust is detached, a sharply
 36653	defined ulcer is exposed, and when this heals it leaves a scar which is
 36654	usually circular, thin, white, shining like satin, and the surrounding
 36655	skin is darkly pigmented; in the case of deep ulcers, the scar is
 36656	depressed and adherent (Fig. 39).
 36657	
 36658	[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Syphilitic Rupia, showing the limpet-shaped
 36659	crusts or scabs.]
 36660	
 36661	In the later stages there may occur a form of creeping or _spreading
 36662	ulceration of the skin_ of the face, groin, or scrotum, healing at one
 36663	edge and spreading at another like tuberculous lupus, but distinguished
 36664	from this by its more rapid progress and by the pigmentation of the
 36665	scar.
 36666	
 36667	_Condylomata_ are more characteristic of syphilis than any other type of
 36668	skin lesion. They are papules occurring on those parts of the body where
 36669	the skin is habitually moist, and especially where two skin surfaces are
 36670	in contact. They are chiefly met with on the external genitals,
 36671	especially in women, around the anus, beneath large pendulous mammae,
 36672	between the toes, and at the angles of the mouth, and in these
 36673	situations their development is greatly favoured by neglect of
 36674	cleanliness. They present the appearance of well-defined circular or
 36675	ovoid areas in which the skin is thickened and raised above the surface;
 36676	they are covered with a white sodden epidermis, and furnish a scanty but
 36677	very infective discharge. Under the influence of irritation and want of
 36678	rest, as at the anus or at the angle of the mouth, they are apt to
 36679	become fissured and superficially ulcerated, and the discharge then
 36680	becomes abundant and may crust on the surface, forming yellow scabs. At
 36681	the angle of the mouth the condylomatous patches may spread to the
 36682	cheek, and when they ulcerate may leave fissure-like scars radiating
 36683	from the mouth--an appearance best seen in inherited syphilis (Fig. 44).
 36684	
 36685	_The Appendages of the Skin._--The _hair_ loses its gloss, becomes dry
 36686	and brittle, and readily falls out, either as an exaggeration of the
 36687	normal shedding of the hair, or in scattered areas over the scalp
 36688	(_syphilitic alopoecia_). The hair is not re-formed in the scars which
 36689	result from ulcerated lesions of the scalp. The _nail-folds_
 36690	occasionally present a pustular eruption and superficial ulceration, to
 36691	which the name _syphilitic onychia_ has been applied; more commonly the
 36692	nails become brittle and ragged, and they may even be shed.
 36693	
 36694	_The Mucous Membranes_, and especially those of the _mouth_ and
 36695	_throat_, suffer from lesions similar to those met with on the skin. On
 36696	a mucous surface the papular eruption assumes the form of _mucous
 36697	patches_, which are areas with a congested base covered with a thin
 36698	white film of sodden epithelium like wet tissue-paper. They are best
 36699	seen on the inner aspect of the cheeks, the soft palate, uvula, pillars
 36700	of the fauces, and tonsils. In addition to mucous patches, there may be
 36701	a number of small, _superficial, kidney-shaped ulcers_, especially along
 36702	the margins of the tongue and on the tonsils. In the absence of mucous
 36703	patches and ulcers, the sore throat may be characterised by a bluish
 36704	tinge of the inflamed mucous membrane and a thin film of shed epithelium
 36705	on the surface. Sometimes there is an elongated sinuous film which has
 36706	been likened to the track of a snail. In the _larynx_ the presence of
 36707	congestion, oedema, and mucous patches may be the cause of persistent
 36708	hoarseness. The _tongue_ often presents a combination of lesions,
 36709	including ulcers, patches where the papillae are absent, fissures, and
 36710	raised white papules resembling warts, especially towards the centre of
 36711	the dorsum. These lesions are specially apt to occur in those who smoke,
 36712	drink undiluted alcohol or spirits, or eat hot condiments to excess, or
 36713	who have irregular, sharp-cornered teeth. At a later period, and in
 36714	those who are broken down in health from intemperance or other cause,
 36715	the sore throat may take the form of rapidly spreading, penetrating
 36716	ulcers in the soft palate and pillars of the fauces, which may lead to
 36717	extensive destruction of tissue, with subsequent scars and deformity
 36718	highly characteristic of previous syphilis.
 36719	
 36720	In the _Bones_, lesions occur which assume the clinical features of an
 36721	evanescent periostitis, the patient complaining of nocturnal pains over
 36722	the frontal bone, sternum, tibiae, and ulnae, and localised tenderness on
 36723	tapping over these bones.
 36724	
 36725	In the _Joints_, a serous synovitis or hydrops may occur, chiefly in the
 36726	knee, on one or on both sides.
 36727	
 36728	_The Affections of the Eyes_, although fortunately rare, are of great
 36729	importance because of the serious results which may follow if they are
 36730	not recognised and treated. _Iritis_ is the commonest of these, and may
 36731	occur in one or in both eyes, one after the other, from three to eight
 36732	months after infection. The patient complains of impairment of sight and
 36733	of frontal or supraorbital pain. The eye waters and is hypersensitive,
 36734	the iris is discoloured and reacts sluggishly to light, and there is a
 36735	zone of ciliary congestion around the cornea. The appearance of minute
 36736	white nodules or flakes of lymph at the margin of the pupil is
 36737	especially characteristic of syphilitic iritis. When adhesions have
 36738	formed between the iris and the structures in relation to it, the pupil
 36739	dilates irregularly under atropin. Although complete recovery is to be
 36740	expected under early and energetic treatment, if neglected, _iritis_ may
 36741	result in occlusion of the pupil and permanent impairment or loss of
 36742	sight.
 36743	
 36744	The other lesions of the eye are much rarer, and can only be discovered
 36745	on ophthalmoscopic examination.
 36746	
 36747	The virus of syphilis exerts a special influence upon the _Blood
 36748	Vessels_, exciting a proliferation of the endothelial lining which
 36749	results in narrowing of their lumen, _endarteritis_, and a perivascular
 36750	infiltration in the form of accumulations of plasma cells around the
 36751	vessels and in the lymphatics that accompany them.
 36752	
 36753	In the _Brain_, in the later periods of secondary and in tertiary
 36754	syphilis, changes occur as a result of the narrowing of the lumen of the
 36755	arteries, or of their complete obliteration by thrombosis. By
 36756	interfering with the nutrition of those parts of the brain supplied by
 36757	the affected arteries, these lesions give rise to clinical features of
 36758	which severe headache and paralysis are the most prominent.
 36759	
 36760	Affections of the _Spinal Cord_ are extremely rare, but paraplegia from
 36761	myelitis has been observed.
 36762	
 36763	Lastly, attention must be directed to the remarkable variations observed
 36764	in different patients. Sometimes the virulent character of the disease
 36765	can only be accounted for by an idiosyncrasy of the patient.
 36766	Constitutional symptoms, particularly pyrexia and anaemia, are most often
 36767	met with in young women. Patients over forty years of age have greater
 36768	difficulty in overcoming the infection than younger adults. Malarial and
 36769	other infections, and the conditions attending life in tropical
 36770	countries, from the debility which they cause, tend to aggravate and
 36771	prolong the disease, which then assumes the characters of what has been
 36772	called _malignant syphilis_. All chronic ailments have a similar
 36773	influence, and alcoholic intemperance is universally regarded as a
 36774	serious aggravating factor.
 36775	
 36776	_Diagnosis of Secondary Syphilis._--A routine examination should be made
 36777	of the parts of the body which are most often affected in this
 36778	disease--the scalp, mouth, throat, posterior cervical glands, and the
 36779	trunk, the patient being stripped and examined by daylight. Among the
 36780	_diagnostic features of the skin affections_ the following may be
 36781	mentioned: They are frequently, and sometimes to a marked degree,
 36782	symmetrical; more than one type of eruption--papules and pustules, for
 36783	example--are present at the same time; there is little itching; they are
 36784	at first a dull-red colour, but later present a brown pigmentation which
 36785	has been likened to the colour of raw ham; they exhibit a predilection
 36786	for those parts of the forehead and neck which are close to the roots of
 36787	the hair; they tend to pass off spontaneously; and they disappear
 36788	rapidly under treatment.
 36789	
 36790	#Serum Diagnosis--Wassermann Reaction.#--Wassermann found that if an
 36791	extract of syphilitic liver rich in spirochaetes is mixed with the serum
 36792	from a syphilitic patient, a large amount of complement is fixed. The
 36793	application of the test is highly complicated and can only be carried
 36794	out by an expert pathologist. For the purpose he is supplied with from 5
 36795	c.c. to 10 c.c. of the patient's blood, withdrawn under aseptic
 36796	conditions from the median basilic vein by means of a serum syringe, and
 36797	transferred to a clean and dry glass tube. There is abundant evidence
 36798	that the Wassermann test is a reliable means of establishing a diagnosis
 36799	of syphilis.
 36800	
 36801	A definitely positive reaction can usually be obtained between the
 36802	fifteenth and thirtieth day after the appearance of the primary lesion,
 36803	and as time goes on it becomes more marked. During the secondary period
 36804	the reaction is practically always positive. In the tertiary stage also
 36805	it is positive except in so far as it is modified by the results of
 36806	treatment. In para-syphilitic lesions such as general paralysis and
 36807	tabes a positive reaction is almost always present. In inherited
 36808	syphilis the reaction is positive in every case. A positive reaction may
 36809	be present in other diseases, for example, frambesia, trypanosomiasis,
 36810	and leprosy.
 36811	
 36812	As the presence of the reaction is an evidence of the activity of the
 36813	spirochaetes, repeated applications of the test furnish a valuable means
 36814	of estimating the efficacy of treatment. The object aimed at is to
 36815	change a persistently positive reaction to a permanently negative one.
 36816	
 36817	#Treatment of Syphilis.#--In the treatment of syphilis the two main
 36818	objects are to maintain the general health at the highest possible
 36819	standard, and to introduce into the system therapeutic agents which will
 36820	inhibit or destroy the invading parasite.
 36821	
 36822	The second of these objects has been achieved by the researches of
 36823	Ehrlich, who, in conjunction with his pupil, Hata, has built up a
 36824	compound, the dihydrochloride of dioxydiamido-arseno-benzol, popularly
 36825	known as salvarsan or "606." Other preparations, such as kharsivan,
 36826	arseno-billon, and diarsenol, are chemically equivalent to salvarsan,
 36827	containing from 27 to 31 per cent. of arsenic, and are equally
 36828	efficient. The full dose is 0.6 grm. All these members of the "606"
 36829	group form an acid solution when dissolved in water, and must be
 36830	rendered alkaline before being injected. As subcutaneous and
 36831	intra-muscular injections cause considerable pain, and may cause
 36832	sloughing of the tissues, "606" preparations must be injected
 36833	intravenously. Ehrlich has devised a preparation--neo-salvarsan, or
 36834	"914," which is more easily prepared and forms a neutral solution. It
 36835	contains from 18 to 20 per cent. of arsenic. Neo-kharsivan,
 36836	novo-arseno-billon, and neo-diarsenol belong to the "914" group, the
 36837	full dosage of which is 0.9 grm. As subcutaneous and intra-muscular
 36838	injections of the "914" group are not painful, and even more efficient
 36839	than intravenous injections, the administration is simpler.
 36840	
 36841	Galyl, luargol, and other preparations act in the same way as the "606"
 36842	and "914" groups.
 36843	
 36844	The "606" preparations may be introduced into the veins by injection or
 36845	by means of an apparatus which allows the solution to flow in by
 36846	gravity. The left median basilic vein is selected, and a platino-iridium
 36847	needle with a short point and a bore larger than that of the ordinary
 36848	hypodermic syringe is used. The needle is passed for a few millimetres
 36849	along the vein, and the solution is then slowly introduced; before
 36850	withdrawing the needle some saline is run in to diminish the risk of
 36851	thrombosis.
 36852	
 36853	The "914" preparations may be injected either into the subcutaneous
 36854	tissue of the buttock or into the substance of the gluteus muscle. The
 36855	part is then massaged for a few minutes, and the massage is repeated
 36856	daily for a few days.
 36857	
 36858	No hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as to what constitutes a
 36859	complete course of treatment. Harrison recommends as a _minimum_ course
 36860	of one of the "914" preparations in _early primary cases_ an initial
 36861	dose of 0.45 grm. given intra-muscularly or into the deep subcutaneous
 36862	tissue; the same dose a week later; 0.6 grm. the following week; then
 36863	miss a week and give 9.6 grms. on two successive weeks; then miss two
 36864	weeks and give 0.6 grm. on two more successive weeks.
 36865	
 36866	When a _positive Wassermann reaction_ is present before treatment is
 36867	commenced, the above course is prolonged as follows: for three weeks is
 36868	given a course of potassium iodide, after which four more weekly
 36869	injections of 0.6 grm. of "914" are given.
 36870	
 36871	With each injection of "914" after the first, throughout the whole
 36872	course 1 grain of mercury is injected intra-muscularly.
 36873	
 36874	In the course of a few hours, there is usually some indisposition, with
 36875	a feeling of chilliness and slight rise of temperature; these symptoms
 36876	pass off within twenty-four hours, and in a few days there is a decided
 36877	improvement of health. Three or four days after an intra-muscular
 36878	injection there may be pain and stiffness in the gluteal region.
 36879	
 36880	These preparations are the most efficient therapeutic agents that have
 36881	yet been employed in the treatment of syphilis.
 36882	
 36883	The manifestations of the disease disappear with remarkable rapidity.
 36884	Observations show that the spirochaetes lose their capacity for movement
 36885	within an hour or two of the administration, and usually disappear
 36886	altogether in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. Wassermann's
 36887	reaction usually yields a negative result in from three weeks to two
 36888	months, but later may again become positive. Subsequent doses of the
 36889	arsenical preparation are therefore usually indicated, and should be
 36890	given in from 7 to 21 days according to the dose.
 36891	
 36892	When syphilis occurs in a _pregnant woman_, she should be given in the
 36893	early months an ordinary course of "914," followed by 10-grain doses of
 36894	potassium iodide twice daily. The injections may be repeated two months
 36895	later, and during the remainder of the pregnancy 2-grain mercury pills
 36896	are given twice daily (A. Campbell). The presence of albumen in the
 36897	urine contra-indicates arsenical treatment.
 36898	
 36899	It need scarcely be pointed out that the use of powerful drugs like
 36900	"606" and "914" is not free from risk; it may be mentioned that each
 36901	dose contains nearly three grains of arsenic. Before the administration
 36902	the patient must be overhauled; its administration is contra-indicated
 36903	in the presence of disease of the heart and blood vessels, especially a
 36904	combination of syphilitic aortitis and sclerosis of the coronary
 36905	arteries, with degeneration of the heart muscle; in affections of the
 36906	central nervous system, especially advanced paralysis, and in such
 36907	disturbances of metabolism as are associated with diabetes and Bright's
 36908	disease. Its use is not contra-indicated in any lesion of active
 36909	syphilis.
 36910	
 36911	The administration is controlled by the systematic examination of the
 36912	urine for arsenic.
 36913	
 36914	_The Administration of Mercury._--The success of the arsenical
 36915	preparations has diminished the importance of mercury in the treatment
 36916	of syphilis, but it is still used to supplement the effect of the
 36917	injections. The amount of mercury to be given in any case must be
 36918	proportioned to the idiosyncrasies of the patient, and it is advisable,
 36919	before commencing the treatment, to test his urine and record his
 36920	body-weight. The small amount of mercury given at the outset is
 36921	gradually increased. If the body-weight falls, or if the gums become
 36922	sore and the breath foul, the mercury should be stopped for a time. If
 36923	salivation occurs, the drinking of hot water and the taking of hot baths
 36924	should be insisted upon, and half-dram doses of the alkaline sulphates
 36925	prescribed.
 36926	
 36927	_Methods of Administering Mercury._--(1) _By the Mouth._--This was for
 36928	long the most popular method in this country, the preparation usually
 36929	employed being grey powder, in pills or tablets, each of which contains
 36930	one grain of the powder. Three of these are given daily in the first
 36931	instance, and the daily dose is increased to five or even seven grains
 36932	till the standard for the individual patient is arrived at. As the grey
 36933	powder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be
 36934	combined with iron, as in the following formula: Hydrarg. c. cret. gr. 1;
 36935	ferri sulph. exsiccat. gr. 1 or 2.
 36936	
 36937	(2) _By Inunction._--Inunction consists in rubbing into the pores of the
 36938	skin an ointment composed of equal parts of 20 per cent. oleate of
 36939	mercury and lanolin. Every night after a hot bath, a dram of the
 36940	ointment (made up by the chemist in paper packets) is rubbed for fifteen
 36941	minutes into the skin where it is soft and comparatively free from
 36942	hairs. When the patient has been brought under the influence of the
 36943	mercury, inunction may be replaced by one of the other methods, of
 36944	administering the drug.
 36945	
 36946	(3) _By Intra-muscular Injection._--This consists in introducing the
 36947	drug by means of a hypodermic syringe into the substance of the gluteal
 36948	muscles. The syringe is made of glass, and has a solid glass piston; the
 36949	needle of platino-iridium should be 5 cm. long and of a larger calibre
 36950	than the ordinary hypodermic needle. The preparation usually employed
 36951	consists of: metallic mercury or calomel 1 dram, lanolin and olive oil
 36952	each 2 drams; it must be warmed to allow of its passage through the
 36953	needle. Five minims--containing one grain of metallic mercury--represent
 36954	a dose, and this is injected into the muscles above and behind the great
 36955	trochanter once a week. The contents of the syringe are slowly
 36956	expressed, and, after withdrawing the needle, gentle massage of the
 36957	buttock should be employed. Four courses each of ten injections are
 36958	given the first year, three courses of the same number during the second
 36959	and third years, and two courses during the fourth year (Lambkin).
 36960	
 36961	_The General Health._--The patient must lead a regular life and
 36962	cultivate the fresh-air habit, which is as beneficial in syphilis as in
 36963	tuberculosis. Anaemia, malaria, and other sources of debility must
 36964	receive appropriate treatment. The diet should be simple and easily
 36965	digested, and should include a full supply of milk. Alcohol is
 36966	prohibited. The excretory organs are encouraged to act by the liberal
 36967	drinking of hot water between meals, say five or six tumblerfuls in the
 36968	twenty-four hours. The functions of the skin are further aided by
 36969	frequent hot baths, and by the wearing of warm underclothing. While the
 36970	patient should avoid exposure to cold, and taxing his energies by undue
 36971	exertion, he should be advised to take exercise in the open air. On
 36972	account of the liability to lesions of the mouth and throat, he should
 36973	use tobacco in moderation, his teeth should be thoroughly overhauled by
 36974	the dentist, and he should brush them after every meal, using an
 36975	antiseptic tooth powder or wash. The mouth and throat should be rinsed
 36976	out night and morning with a solution of chlorate of potash and alum, or
 36977	with peroxide of hydrogen.
 36978	
 36979	_Treatment of the Local Manifestations._--_The skin lesions_ are treated
 36980	on the same lines as similar eruptions of other origin. As local
 36981	applications, preparations of mercury are usually selected, notably the
 36982	ointments of the red oxide of mercury, ammoniated mercury, or oleate of
 36983	mercury (5 per cent.), or the mercurial plaster introduced by Unna. In
 36984	the treatment of condylomata the greatest attention must be paid to
 36985	cleanliness and dryness. After washing and drying the affected patches,
 36986	they are dusted with a powder consisting of equal parts of calomel and
 36987	carbonate of zinc; and apposed skin surfaces, such as the nates or
 36988	labia, are separated by sublimate wool. In the ulcers of later secondary
 36989	syphilis, crusts are got rid of in the first instance by means of a
 36990	boracic poultice, after which a piece of lint or gauze cut to the size
 36991	of the ulcer and soaked in black wash is applied and covered with
 36992	oil-silk. If the ulcer tends to spread in area or in depth, it should be
 36993	scraped with a sharp spoon, and painted over with acid nitrate of
 36994	mercury, or a local hyperaemia may be induced by Klapp's suction
 36995	apparatus.
 36996	
 36997	_In lesions of the mouth and throat_, the teeth should be attended to;
 36998	the best local application is a solution of chromic acid--10 grains to
 36999	the ounce--painted on with a brush once daily. If this fails, the
 37000	lesions may be dusted with calomel the last thing at night. For deep
 37001	ulcers of the throat the patient should gargle frequently with chlorine
 37002	water or with perchloride of mercury (1 in 2000); if the ulcer continues
 37003	to spread it should be painted with acid nitrate of mercury.
 37004	
 37005	In the treatment of _iritis_ the eyes are shaded from the light and
 37006	completely rested, and the pupil is well dilated by atropin to prevent
 37007	adhesions. If there is much pain, a blister may be applied to the
 37008	temple.
 37009	
 37010	_The Relations of Syphilis to Marriage._--Before the introduction of the
 37011	Ehrlich-Hata treatment no patient was allowed to marry until three years
 37012	had elapsed after the disappearance of the last manifestation. While
 37013	marriage might be entered upon under these conditions without risk of
 37014	the husband infecting the wife, the possibility of his conveying the
 37015	disease to the offspring cannot be absolutely excluded. It is
 37016	recommended, as a precautionary measure, to give a further mercurial
 37017	course of two or three months' duration before marriage, and an
 37018	intravenous injection of an arsenical preparation.
 37019	
 37020	#Intermediate Stage.#--After the dying away of the secondary
 37021	manifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the
 37022	patient may present certain symptoms which Hutchinson called
 37023	_reminders_. These usually consist of relapses of certain of the
 37024	affections of the skin, mouth, or throat, already described. In the
 37025	skin, they may assume the form of peeling patches in the palms, or may
 37026	appear as spreading and confluent circles of a scaly papular eruption,
 37027	which if neglected may lead to the formation of fissures and superficial
 37028	ulcers. Less frequently there is a relapse of the eye affections, or of
 37029	paralytic symptoms from disease of the cerebral arteries.
 37030	
 37031	#Tertiary Syphilis.#--While the manifestations of primary and secondary
 37032	syphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison
 37033	rare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected
 37034	treatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by
 37035	privation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.
 37036	
 37037	It is to be borne in mind that in a certain proportion of men and in a
 37038	larger proportion of women, the patient has no knowledge of having
 37039	suffered from syphilis. Certain slight but important signs may give the
 37040	clue in a number of cases, such as irregularity of the pupils or failure
 37041	to react to light, abnormality of the reflexes, and the discovery of
 37042	patches of leucoplakia on the tongue, cheek, or palate.
 37043	
 37044	The _general character of tertiary manifestations_ may be stated as
 37045	follows: They attack by preference the tissues derived from the
 37046	mesoblastic layer of the embryo--the cellular tissue, bones, muscles,
 37047	and viscera. They are often localised to one particular tissue or organ,
 37048	such, for example, as the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the bones, or
 37049	the liver, and they are rarely symmetrical. They are usually aggressive
 37050	and persistent, with little tendency to natural cure, and they may be
 37051	dangerous to life, because of the destructive changes produced in such
 37052	organs as the brain or the larynx. They are remarkably amenable to
 37053	treatment if instituted before the stage which is attended with
 37054	destruction of tissue is reached. Early tertiary lesions may be
 37055	infective, and the disease may be transmitted by the discharges from
 37056	them; but the later the lesions the less is the risk of their containing
 37057	an infective virus.
 37058	
 37059	The most prominent feature of tertiary syphilis consists in the
 37060	formation of granulation tissue, and this takes place on a scale
 37061	considerably larger than that observed in lesions of the secondary
 37062	period. The granulation tissue frequently forms a definite swelling or
 37063	tumour-like mass (syphiloma), which, from its peculiar elastic
 37064	consistence, is known as a _gumma_. In its early stages a gumma is a
 37065	firm, semi-translucent greyish or greyish-red mass of tissue; later it
 37066	becomes opaque, yellow, and caseous, with a tendency to soften and
 37067	liquefy. The gumma does harm by displacing and replacing the normal
 37068	tissue elements of the part affected, and by involving these in the
 37069	degenerative changes, of the nature of caseation and necrosis, which
 37070	produce the destructive lesions of the skin, mucous membranes, and
 37071	internal organs. This is true not only of the circumscribed gumma, but
 37072	of the condition known as _gummatous infiltration_ or _syphilitic
 37073	cirrhosis_, in which the granulation tissue is diffused throughout the
 37074	connective-tissue framework of such organs as the tongue or liver. Both
 37075	the gummatous lesions and the fibrosis of tertiary syphilis are directly
 37076	excited by the spirochaetes.
 37077	
 37078	The life-history of an untreated gumma varies with its environment. When
 37079	protected from injury and irritation in the substance of an internal
 37080	organ such as the liver, it may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue,
 37081	and persist in this condition for an indefinite period, or it may be
 37082	absorbed and leave in its place a fibrous cicatrix. In the interior of a
 37083	long bone it may replace the rigid framework of the shaft to such an
 37084	extent as to lead to pathological fracture. If it is near the surface of
 37085	the body--as, for example, in the subcutaneous or submucous cellular
 37086	tissue, or in the periosteum of a superficial bone, such as the palate,
 37087	the skull, or the tibia--the tissue of which it is composed is apt to
 37088	undergo necrosis, in which the overlying skin or mucous membrane
 37089	frequently participates, the result being an ulcer--the tertiary
 37090	syphilitic ulcer (Figs. 40 and 41).
 37091	
 37092	_Tertiary Lesions of the Skin and Subcutaneous Cellular Tissue._--The
 37093	clinical features of a _subcutaneous gumma_ are those of an indolent,
 37094	painless, elastic swelling, varying in size from a pea to an almond or
 37095	walnut. After a variable period it usually softens in the centre, the
 37096	skin over it becomes livid and dusky, and finally separates as a slough,
 37097	exposing the tissue of the gumma, which sometimes appears as a mucoid,
 37098	yellowish, honey-like substance, more frequently as a sodden, caseated
 37099	tissue resembling wash-leather. The caseated tissue of a gumma differs
 37100	from that of a tuberculous lesion in being tough and firm, of a buff
 37101	colour like wash-leather, or whitish, like boiled fish. The degenerated
 37102	tissue separates slowly and gradually, and in untreated cases may be
 37103	visible for weeks in the floor of the ulcer.
 37104	
 37105	[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Ulcerating Gumma of Lips.
 37106	
 37107	(From a photograph lent by Dr. Stopford Taylor and Dr. R. W. Mackenna.)]
 37108	
 37109	_The tertiary ulcer_ may be situated anywhere, but is most frequently
 37110	met with on the leg, especially in the region of the knee (Fig. 42) and
 37111	over the calf. There may be one or more ulcers, and also scars of
 37112	antecedent ulcers. The edges are sharply cut, as if punched out; the
 37113	margins are rounded in outline, firm, and congested; the base is
 37114	occupied by gummatous tissue, or, if this has already separated and
 37115	sloughed out, by unhealthy granulations and a thick purulent discharge.
 37116	When the ulcer has healed it leaves a scar which is depressed, and if
 37117	over a bone, is adherent to it. The features of the tertiary ulcer,
 37118	however, are not always so characteristic as the above description would
 37119	imply. It is to be diagnosed from the "leg ulcer," which occurs almost
 37120	exclusively on the lower third of the leg; from Bazin's disease (p. 74);
 37121	from the ulcers that result from certain forms of malignant disease,
 37122	such as rodent cancer, and from those met with in chronic glanders.
 37123	
 37124	_Gummatous Infiltration of the Skin_ ("Syphilitic Lupus").--This is a
 37125	lesion, met with chiefly on the face and in the region of the external
 37126	genitals, in which the skin becomes infiltrated with granulation tissue
 37127	so that it is thickened, raised above the surface, and of a brownish-red
 37128	colour. It appears as isolated nodules, which may fuse together; the
 37129	epidermis becomes scaly and is shed, giving rise to superficial ulcers
 37130	which are usually covered by crusted discharge. The disease tends to
 37131	spread, creeping over the skin with a serpiginous, crescentic, or
 37132	horse-shoe margin, while the central portion may heal and leave a scar.
 37133	From the fact of its healing in the centre while it spreads at the
 37134	margin, it may resemble tuberculous disease of the skin. It can usually
 37135	be differentiated by observing that the infiltration is on a larger
 37136	scale; the progress is much more rapid, involving in the course of
 37137	months an area which in the case of tuberculosis would require as many
 37138	years; the scars are sounder and are less liable to break down again;
 37139	and the disease rapidly yields to anti-syphilitic treatment.
 37140	
 37141	[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Ulceration of nineteen year's duration
 37142	in a woman aet. 24, the subject of inherited syphilis, showing active
 37143	ulceration, cicatricial contraction, and sabre-blade deformity of
 37144	tibiae.]
 37145	
 37146	_Tertiary lesions of mucous membrane and of the submucous cellular
 37147	tissue_ are met with chiefly in the tongue, nose, throat, larynx, and
 37148	rectum. They originate as gummata or as gummatous infiltrations, which
 37149	are liable to break down and lead to the formation of ulcers which may
 37150	prove locally destructive, and, in such situations as the larynx, even
 37151	dangerous to life. In the tongue the tertiary ulcer may prove the
 37152	starting-point of cancer; and in the larynx or rectum the healing of the
 37153	ulcer may lead to cicatricial stenosis.
 37154	
 37155	Tertiary lesions of the _bones and joints_, of the _muscles_, and of the
 37156	_internal organs_, will be described under these heads. The part played
 37157	by syphilis in the production of disease of arteries and of aneurysm
 37158	will be referred to along with diseases of blood vessels.
 37159	
 37160	[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Tertiary Syphilitic Ulceration in region of
 37161	Knee and on both Thumbs of woman aet. 37.]
 37162	
 37163	_Treatment._--The most valuable drugs for the treatment of the
 37164	manifestations of the tertiary period are the arsenical preparations and
 37165	the iodides of sodium and potassium. On account of their depressing
 37166	effects, the latter are frequently prescribed along with carbonate of
 37167	ammonium. The dose is usually a matter of experiment in each individual
 37168	case; 5 grains three times a day may suffice, or it may be necessary to
 37169	increase each dose to 20 or 25 grains. The symptoms of iodism which may
 37170	follow from the smaller doses usually disappear on giving a larger
 37171	amount of the drug. It should be taken after meals, with abundant water
 37172	or other fluid, especially if given in tablet form. It is advisable to
 37173	continue the iodides for from one to three months after the lesions for
 37174	which they are given have cleared up. If the potassium salt is not
 37175	tolerated, it may be replaced by the ammonium or sodium iodide.
 37176	
 37177	_Local Treatment._--The absorption of a subcutaneous gumma is often
 37178	hastened by the application of a fly-blister. When a gumma has broken on
 37179	the surface and caused an ulcer, this is treated on general principles,
 37180	with a preference, however, for applications containing mercury or
 37181	iodine, or both. If a wet dressing is required to cleanse the ulcer,
 37182	black wash may be used; if a powder to promote dryness, one containing
 37183	iodoform; if an ointment is indicated, the choice lies between the red
 37184	oxide of mercury or the dilute nitrate of mercury ointment, and one
 37185	consisting of equal parts of lanolin and vaselin with 2 per cent. of
 37186	iodine. Deep ulcers, and obstinate lesions of the bones, larynx, and
 37187	other parts may be treated by excision or scraping with the sharp spoon.
 37188	
 37189	#Second Attacks of Syphilis.#--Instances of re-infection of syphilis
 37190	have been recorded with greater frequency since the more general
 37191	introduction of arsenical treatment. A remarkable feature in such cases
 37192	is the shortness of the interval between the original infection and the
 37193	alleged re-infection; in a recent series of twenty-eight cases, this
 37194	interval was less than a year. Another feature of interest is that when
 37195	patients in the tertiary stage of syphilis are inoculated with the virus
 37196	from lesions from these in the primary and secondary stage lesions of
 37197	the tertiary type are produced.
 37198	
 37199	Reference may be made to the #relapsing false indurated chancre#,
 37200	described by Hutchinson and by Fournier, as it may be the source of
 37201	difficulty in diagnosis. A patient who has had an infecting chancre one
 37202	or more years before, may present a slightly raised induration on the
 37203	penis at or close to the site of his original sore. This relapsed
 37204	induration is often so like that of a primary chancre that it is
 37205	impossible to distinguish between them, except by the history. If there
 37206	has been a recent exposure to venereal infection, it is liable to be
 37207	regarded as the primary lesion of a second attack of syphilis, but the
 37208	further progress shows that neither bullet-buboes nor secondary
 37209	manifestations develop. These facts, together with the disappearance of
 37210	the induration under treatment, make it very likely that the lesion is
 37211	really gummatous in character.
 37212	
 37213	
 37214	INHERITED SYPHILIS
 37215	
 37216	One of the most striking features of syphilis is that it may be
 37217	transmitted from infected parents to their offspring, the children
 37218	exhibiting the manifestations that characterise the acquired form of the
 37219	disease.
 37220	
 37221	The more recent the syphilis in the parent, the greater is the risk of
 37222	the disease being communicated to the offspring; so that if either
 37223	parent suffers from secondary syphilis the infection is almost
 37224	inevitably transmitted.
 37225	
 37226	While it is certain that either parent may be responsible for
 37227	transmitting the disease to the next generation, the method of
 37228	transmission is not known. In the case of a syphilitic mother it is most
 37229	probable that the infection is conveyed to the foetus by the placental
 37230	circulation. In the case of a syphilitic father, it is commonly believed
 37231	that the infection is conveyed to the ovum through the seminal fluid at
 37232	the moment of conception. If a series of children, one after the other,
 37233	suffer from inherited syphilis, it is almost invariably the case that
 37234	the mother has been infected.
 37235	
 37236	In contrast to the acquired form, inherited syphilis is remarkable for
 37237	the absence of any primary stage, the infection being a general one from
 37238	the outset. The spirochaete is demonstrated in incredible numbers in the
 37239	liver, spleen, lung, and other organs, and in the nasal secretion, and,
 37240	from any of these, successful inoculations in monkeys can readily be
 37241	made. The manifestations differ in degree rather than in kind from those
 37242	of the acquired disease; the difference is partly due to the fact that
 37243	the virus is attacking developing instead of fully formed tissues.
 37244	
 37245	The virus exercises an injurious influence on the foetus, which in many
 37246	cases dies during the early months of intra-uterine life, so that
 37247	miscarriage results, and this may take place in repeated pregnancies,
 37248	the date at which the miscarriage occurs becoming later as the virus in
 37249	the mother becomes attenuated. Eventually a child is carried to full
 37250	term, and it may be still-born, or, if born alive, may suffer from
 37251	syphilitic manifestations. It is difficult to explain such vagaries of
 37252	syphilitic inheritance as the infection of one twin and the escape of
 37253	the other.
 37254	
 37255	_Clinical Features._--We are not here concerned with the severe forms of
 37256	the disease which prove fatal, but with the milder forms in which the
 37257	infant is apparently healthy when born, but after from two to six weeks
 37258	begins to show evidence of the syphilitic taint.
 37259	
 37260	The usual phenomena are that the child ceases to thrive, becomes thin
 37261	and sallow, and suffers from eruptions on the skin and mucous membranes.
 37262	There is frequently a condition known as _snuffles_, in which the nasal
 37263	passages are obstructed by an accumulation of thin muco-purulent
 37264	discharge which causes the breathing to be noisy. It usually begins
 37265	within a month after birth and before the eruptions on the skin appear.
 37266	When long continued it is liable to interfere with the development of
 37267	the nasal bones, so that when the child grows up there results a
 37268	condition known as the "saddle-nose" deformity (Figs. 43 and 44).

 37272	(From Dr. Byrom Bramwell's _Atlas of Clinical Medicine_.)]
 37273	
 37274	_Affections of the Skin._--Although all types of skin affection are met
 37275	with in the inherited disease, the most important is a _papular_
 37276	eruption, the papules being of large size, with a smooth shining top and
 37277	of a reddish-brown colour. It affects chiefly the buttocks and thighs,
 37278	the genitals, and other parts which are constantly moist. It is
 37279	necessary to distinguish this specific eruption from a form of eczema
 37280	which occurs in these situations in non-syphilitic children, the points
 37281	that characterise the syphilitic condition being the infiltration of the
 37282	skin and the coppery colour of the eruption. At the anus the papules
 37283	acquire the characters of _condylomata_, also at the angles of the
 37284	mouth, where they often ulcerate and leave radiating scars.
 37285	
 37286	_Affections of the Mucous Membranes._--The inflammation of the nasal
 37287	mucous membrane that causes snuffles has already been referred to. There
 37288	may be mucous patches in the mouth, or a stomatitis which is of
 37289	importance, because it results in interference with the development of
 37290	the permanent teeth. The mucous membrane of the larynx may be the seat
 37291	of mucous patches or of catarrh, and as a result the child's cry is
 37292	hoarse.
 37293	
 37294	_Affections of the Bones._--Swellings at the ends of the long bones, due
 37295	to inflammation at the epiphysial junctions, are most often observed at
 37296	the upper end of the humerus and in the bones in the region of the
 37297	elbow. Partial displacement and mobility at the ossifying junction may
 37298	be observed. The infant cries when the part is touched; and as it does
 37299	not move the limb voluntarily, the condition is spoken of as _the
 37300	pseudo-paralysis of syphilis_. Recovery takes place under
 37301	anti-syphilitic treatment and immobilisation of the limb.
 37302	
 37303	Diffuse thickening of the shafts of the long bones, due to a deposit of
 37304	new bone by the periosteum, is sometimes met with.
 37305	
 37306	[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Facies of Inherited Syphilis.]
 37307	
 37308	The conditions of the skull known as Parrot's nodes or bosses, and
 37309	craniotabes, were formerly believed to be characteristic of inherited
 37310	syphilis, but they are now known to occur, particularly in rickety
 37311	children, from other causes. The _bosses_ result from the heaping up of
 37312	new spongy bone beneath the pericranium, and they may be grouped
 37313	symmetrically around the anterior fontanelle, or may extend along either
 37314	side of the sagittal suture, which appears as a deep groove--the
 37315	"natiform skull." The bosses disappear in time, but the skull may remain
 37316	permanently altered in shape, the frontal and parietal eminences
 37317	appearing unduly prominent. The term _craniotabes_ is applied when the
 37318	bone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous
 37319	condition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like
 37320	parchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of
 37321	the skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is
 37322	influenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow. Craniotabes is
 37323	recovered from as the child improves in health.
 37324	
 37325	Between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be
 37326	met with, such as _effusion into the joints_, especially the knees;
 37327	_iritis_, in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and
 37328	liver.
 37329	
 37330	In the majority of cases the child recovers from these early
 37331	manifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an
 37332	indefinite period of good health. On the other hand, when it attains the
 37333	age of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which
 37334	correspond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.
 37335	
 37336	#Later Lesions.#--In the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the later
 37337	manifestations may take the form of localised gummata, which tend to
 37338	break down and form ulcers, on the leg for example, or of a spreading
 37339	gummatous infiltration which is also liable to ulcerate, leaving
 37340	disfiguring scars, especially on the face. The palate and fauces may be
 37341	destroyed by ulceration. In the nose, especially when the ulcerative
 37342	process is associated with a putrid discharge--ozaena--the destruction of
 37343	tissue may be considerable and result in unsightly deformity. The entire
 37344	palatal portions of the upper jaws, the vomer, turbinate, and other
 37345	bones bounding the nasal and oral cavities, may disappear, so that on
 37346	looking into the mouth the base of the skull is readily seen. Gummatous
 37347	disease is frequently observed also in the flat bones of the skull, in
 37348	the bones of the hand, as syphilitic dactylitis, and in the bones of the
 37349	forearm and leg. When the tibia is affected the disease is frequently
 37350	bilateral, and may assume the form of gummatous ulcers and sinuses. In
 37351	later years the tibia may present alterations in shape resulting from
 37352	antecedent gummatous disease--for example, nodular thickenings of the
 37353	shaft, flattening of the crest, or a more uniform increase in thickness
 37354	and length of the shaft of the bone, which, when it is curved in
 37355	addition, is described as the "sabre-blade" deformity. Among lesions of
 37356	the viscera, mention should be made of gumma of the testis, which causes
 37357	the organ to become enlarged, uneven, and indurated. This has even been
 37358	observed in infants a few months old.
 37359	
 37360	Occasionally a syphilitic child suffers from a succession of these
 37361	gummatous lesions with resulting ill-health, and, it may be, waxy
 37362	disease of the internal organs; on the other hand, it may recover and
 37363	present no further manifestations of the inherited taint.
 37364	
 37365	_Affections of the Eyes._--At or near puberty there is frequently
 37366	observed an affection of the eyes, known as _chronic interstitial
 37367	keratitis_, the relationship of which to inherited syphilis was first
 37368	established by Hutchinson. It occurs between the ages of six and sixteen
 37369	years, and usually affects one eye before the other. It commences as a
 37370	diffuse haziness or steaminess near the centre of the cornea, and as it
 37371	spreads the entire cornea assumes the appearance of ground glass. The
 37372	chief complaint is of dimness of sight, which may almost amount to
 37373	blindness, but there is little pain or photophobia; a certain amount of
 37374	conjunctival and ciliary congestion is usually present, and there may be
 37375	_iritis_ in addition. The cornea, or parts of it, may become of a deep
 37376	pink or salmon colour from the formation in it of new blood vessels. The
 37377	affection may last for from eighteen months to two years. Complete
 37378	recovery usually takes place, but slight opacities, especially in the
 37379	site of former salmon patches, may persist, and the disease occasionally
 37380	relapses. _Choroiditis_ and _retinitis_ may also occur, and leave
 37381	permanent changes easily recognised on examination with the
 37382	ophthalmoscope.
 37383	
 37384	Among the rarer and more serious lesions of the inherited disease may be
 37385	mentioned gummatous disease in the _larynx and trachea_, attended with
 37386	ulceration and resulting in stenosis; and lesions of the _nervous
 37387	system_ which may result in convulsions, paralysis, or dementia.
 37388	
 37389	In a limited number of cases, about the period of puberty there may
 37390	develop _deafness_, which is usually bilateral and may become absolute.
 37391	
 37392	_Changes in the Permanent Teeth._--These affect specially the upper
 37393	central incisors, which are dwarfed and stand somewhat apart in the gum,
 37394	with their free edges converging towards one another. They are tapering
 37395	or peg-shaped, and present at their cutting margin a deep semilunar
 37396	notch. These appearances are commonly associated with the name of
 37397	Hutchinson, who first described them. Affecting as they do the
 37398	permanent teeth, they are not available for diagnosis until the child is
 37399	over eight years of age. Henry Moon drew attention to a change in the
 37400	first molars; these are reduced in size and dome-shaped through dwarfing
 37401	of the central tubercle of each cusp.
 37402	
 37403	#Diagnosis of Inherited Syphilis.#--When there is a typical eruption on
 37404	the buttocks and snuffles there is no difficulty in recognising the
 37405	disease. When, however, the rash is scanty or is obscured by co-existing
 37406	eczema, most reliance should be placed on the distribution of the
 37407	eruption, on the brown stains which are left after it has passed off, on
 37408	the presence of condylomata, and of fissuring and scarring at the angles
 37409	of the mouth. The history of the mother relative to repeated
 37410	miscarriages and still-born children may afford confirmatory evidence.
 37411	In doubtful cases, the diagnosis may be aided by the Wassermann test and
 37412	by noting the therapeutic effects of grey powder, which, in syphilitic
 37413	infants, usually effects a marked and rapid improvement both in the
 37414	symptoms and in the general health.
 37415	
 37416	While a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without
 37417	showing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain
 37418	throughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may
 37419	therefore be described as _permanent signs of the inherited disease_:
 37420	Dwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial
 37421	junctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal
 37422	eminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded;
 37423	radiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction
 37424	of the hard palate; Hutchinson's teeth; opacities of the cornea from
 37425	antecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis;
 37426	deafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata;
 37427	"sabre-blade" or other deformity of the tibiae.
 37428	
 37429	#The Contagiousness of Inherited Syphilis.#--In 1837, Colles of Dublin
 37430	stated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease
 37431	to a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if
 37432	nursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the
 37433	disease. This doctrine, which is known as _Colles' law_, is generally
 37434	accepted in spite of the alleged occurrence of occasional exceptions.
 37435	The older the child, the less risk there is of its communicating the
 37436	disease to others, until eventually the tendency dies out altogether, as
 37437	it does in the tertiary period of acquired syphilis. It should be
 37438	added, however, that the contagiousness of inherited syphilis is denied
 37439	by some observers, who affirm that, when syphilitic infants prove
 37440	infective, the disease has been really acquired at or soon after birth.
 37441	
 37442	There is general agreement that the subjects of inherited syphilis
 37443	cannot transmit the disease by inheritance to their offspring, and that,
 37444	although they very rarely acquire the disease _de novo_, it is possible
 37445	for them to do so.
 37446	
 37447	#Prognosis of Inherited Syphilis.#--Although inherited syphilis is
 37448	responsible for a large but apparently diminishing mortality in infancy,
 37449	the subjects of this disease may grow up to be as strong and healthy as
 37450	their neighbours. Hutchinson insisted on the fact that there is little
 37451	bad health in the general community that can be attributed to inherited
 37452	syphilis.
 37453	
 37454	#Treatment.#--Arsenical injections are as beneficial in the inherited as
 37455	in the acquired disease. An infant the subject of inherited syphilis
 37456	should, if possible, be nursed by its mother, and failing this it should
 37457	be fed by hand. In infants at the breast, the drug may be given to the
 37458	mother; in others, it is administered in the same manner as already
 37459	described--only in smaller doses. On the first appearance of syphilitic
 37460	manifestations it should be given 0.05 grm, novarsenbillon, injected
 37461	into the deep subcutaneous tissues every week for six weeks, followed by
 37462	one year's mercurial inunction--a piece of mercurial ointment the size
 37463	of a pea being inserted under the infant's binder. In older children the
 37464	dose is proportionately increased. The general health should be improved
 37465	in every possible direction; considerable benefit may be derived from
 37466	the use of cod-liver oil, and from preparations containing iron and
 37467	calcium. Surgical interference may be required in the destructive
 37468	gummatous lesions of the nose, throat, larynx, and bones, either with
 37469	the object of arresting the spread of the disease, or of removing or
 37470	alleviating the resulting deformities. In children suffering from
 37471	keratitis, the eyes should be protected from the light by smoked or
 37472	coloured glasses, and the pupils should be dilated with atropin from
 37473	time to time, especially in cases complicated with iritis.
 37474	
 37475	#Acquired Syphilis in Infants and Young Children.#--When syphilis is met
 37476	with in infants and young children, it is apt to be taken for granted
 37477	that the disease has been inherited. It is possible, however, for them
 37478	to acquire the disease--as, for example, while passing through the
 37479	maternal passages during birth, through being nursed or kissed by
 37480	infected women, or through the rite of circumcision. The risk of
 37481	infection which formerly existed by the arm-to-arm method of
 37482	vaccination has been abolished by the use of calf lymph.
 37483	
 37484	The clinical features of the acquired disease in infants and young
 37485	children are similar to those observed in the adult, with a tendency,
 37486	however, to be more severe, probably because the disease is often late
 37487	in being recognised and treated.

 37507	
 37508	[2] For the histology of tumours the reader is referred to a text-book
 37509	of pathology.
 37510	
 37511	A tumour or neoplasm is a localised swelling composed of newly formed
 37512	tissue which fulfils no physiological function. Tumours increase in size
 37513	quite independently of the growth of the body, and there is no natural
 37514	termination to their growth. They are to be distinguished from such
 37515	over-growths as are of the nature of simple hypertrophy or local
 37516	giantism, and also from inflammatory swellings, which usually develop
 37517	under the influence of a definite cause, have a natural termination, and
 37518	tend to disappear when the cause ceases to act.
 37519	
 37520	The _etiology of tumours_ is imperfectly understood. Various factors,
 37521	acting either singly or in combination, may be concerned in their
 37522	development. Certain tumours, for example, are the result of some
 37523	congenital malformation of the particular tissue from which they take
 37524	origin. This would appear to be the case in many tumours of blood
 37525	vessels (angioma), of cartilage (chondroma), of bone (osteoma), and of
 37526	secreting gland tissue (adenoma). The theory that tumours originate from
 37527	foetal residues or "rests," is associated with the name of Cohnheim.
 37528	These rests are supposed to be undifferentiated embryonic cells which
 37529	remain embedded amongst fully formed tissue elements, and lie dormant
 37530	until they are excited into active growth and give rise to a tumour.
 37531	This mode of origin is illustrated by the development of dermoids from
 37532	sequestrated portions of epidermis.
 37533	
 37534	Among the local factors concerned in the development of tumours,
 37535	reference must be made to the influence of irritation. This is probably
 37536	an important agent in the causation of many of the tumours met with in
 37537	the skin and in mucous membranes--for example, cancer of the skin, of
 37538	the lip, and of the tongue. The part played by injury is doubtful. It
 37539	not infrequently happens that the development of a tumour is preceded by
 37540	an injury of the part in which it grows, but it does not necessarily
 37541	follow that the injury and the tumour are related as cause and effect.
 37542	It is possible that an injury may stimulate into active growth
 37543	undifferentiated tissue elements or "rests," and so determine the growth
 37544	of a tumour, or that it may alter the characters of a tumour which
 37545	already exists, causing it to grow more rapidly.
 37546	
 37547	The popular belief that there is some constitutional peculiarity
 37548	concerned in the causation of tumours is largely based on the fact that
 37549	certain forms of new growth--for example, cancer--are known to occur
 37550	with undue frequency in certain families. The same influence is more
 37551	striking in the case of certain innocent tumours--particularly multiple
 37552	osteomas and lipomas--which are hereditary in the same sense as
 37553	supernumerary or webbed fingers, and appear in members of the same
 37554	family through several generations.
 37555	
 37556	
 37557	INNOCENT AND MALIGNANT TUMOURS
 37558	
 37559	For clinical purposes, tumours are arbitrarily divided into two
 37560	classes--the innocent and the malignant. The outstanding difference
 37561	between them is, that while the evil effects of innocent tumours are
 37562	entirely local and depend for their severity on the environment of the
 37563	growth, malignant tumours wherever situated, in addition to producing
 37564	similar local effects, injure the general health and ultimately cause
 37565	death.
 37566	
 37567	_Innocent_, benign, or simple tumours present a close structural
 37568	resemblance to the normal tissues of the body. They grow slowly, and are
 37569	usually definitely circumscribed by a fibrous capsule, from which they
 37570	are easily enucleated, and they do not tend to recur after removal. In
 37571	their growth they merely push aside and compress adjacent parts, and
 37572	they present no tendency to ulcerate and bleed unless the overlying skin
 37573	or mucous membrane is injured. Although usually solitary, some are
 37574	multiple from the outset--for example, fatty, fibrous, and bony tumours,
 37575	warts, and fibroid tumours of the uterus. They produce no constitutional
 37576	disturbance. They only threaten life when growing in the vicinity of
 37577	vital organs, and then only in virtue of their situation--for example,
 37578	death may result from an innocent tumour in the air-passage causing
 37579	suffocation, in the intestine causing obstruction of the bowels, or in
 37580	the vertebral canal causing pressure on the spinal medulla.
 37581	
 37582	_Malignant tumours_ usually show a marked departure from the structure
 37583	and arrangement of the normal tissues of the body. Although the cells of
 37584	which they are composed are derived from normal tissue cells, they tend
 37585	to take on a lower, more vegetative form; they may be regarded as
 37586	parasites living at the expense of the organism, multiplying
 37587	indefinitely and destroying everything with which they come in contact.
 37588	
 37589	Malignant tumours grow more rapidly than innocent tumours, and tend to
 37590	infiltrate their surroundings by sending out prolongations or offshoots;
 37591	they are therefore liable to recur after an operation which is
 37592	restricted to the removal of the main tumour. They are not encapsulated,
 37593	although they may appear to be circumscribed by condensation of the
 37594	surrounding tissues; they are rarely multiple at the outset, but show a
 37595	marked tendency to spread to other parts of the body. Fragments of the
 37596	parent tumour may become separated and be carried off in the lymph or
 37597	blood-stream and deposited in other parts of the body, where they give
 37598	rise to secondary growths. Malignant tumours tend to invade and destroy
 37599	the overlying skin or mucous membrane, and thus give rise to bleeding
 37600	ulcers; if the tumour tissue protrudes through the gap in the skin, it
 37601	is said to _fungate_. In course of time they give rise to a condition of
 37602	ill-health or _cachexia_, the patient becoming pale, sallow, feverish,
 37603	and emaciated, probably as a result of chronic poisoning from the
 37604	absorption of toxic products from the tumour. They ultimately destroy
 37605	life, it may be by their local effects, such as ulceration and
 37606	haemorrhage, by favouring the entrance of septic infection, by
 37607	interfering with the function of organs which are essential to life, by
 37608	cachexia, or by a combination of these effects.
 37609	
 37610	The situation of a malignant tumour exercises considerable influence on
 37611	the rapidity, as well as on the mode, in which it causes death. Some
 37612	cancers, such as that known as "rodent," show malignant features which
 37613	are entirely local, while others, such as melanotic cancer, exhibit a
 37614	malignancy characterised by rapid generalisation of growths throughout
 37615	the body. Tumours that are structurally alike may show variations in
 37616	malignancy, according to their situation and to the age of the patient,
 37617	as well as to other factors which are as yet unknown.
 37618	
 37619	In attempting to arrive at a conclusion as to the innocence or
 37620	malignancy of any tumour, too much reliance must not be placed on its
 37621	histological features; its situation, rate of growth, and other clinical
 37622	features must also be taken into consideration. It cannot be too
 37623	emphatically stated that there is no hard-and-fast line between innocent
 37624	and malignant growths; there is an indefinite transition from one to the
 37625	other. The possibility of the transformation of a benign into a
 37626	malignant tumour must be admitted. Such a transformation implies a
 37627	change in the structure of the growth, and has been observed especially
 37628	in fibrous and cartilaginous tumours, in tumours of the thyreoid gland,
 37629	and in uterine fibroids. The alteration in character may take place
 37630	under the influence of injury, prolonged or repeated irritation,
 37631	incomplete removal of the benign tumour by operation, or the altered
 37632	physiological conditions of the tissues which attend upon advancing
 37633	years.
 37634	
 37635	After a tumour has been removed by operation it should as a routine
 37636	measure be subjected to microscopical examination; the results are often
 37637	instructive and sometimes other than what was expected.
 37638	
 37639	#Varieties of Tumours.#--In the following description, tumours are
 37640	classified on an anatomical basis, taking in order first the
 37641	connective-tissue group and subsequently those that originate in
 37642	epithelium.
 37643	
 37644	
 37645	INNOCENT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS
 37646	
 37647	#Lipoma.#--A lipoma is composed of fat resembling that normally present
 37648	in the body. The commonest variety is the _subcutaneous lipoma_, which
 37649	grows from the subcutaneous fat, and forms a soft, irregularly lobulated
 37650	tumour (Fig. 45). The fat is arranged in lobules separated by
 37651	connective-tissue septa, which are continuous with the capsule
 37652	surrounding the tumour and with the overlying skin, which becomes
 37653	dimpled or puckered when an attempt is made to pinch it up. As the fat
 37654	is almost fluid at the body temperature, fluctuation can usually be
 37655	detected. These tumours vary greatly in size, occur at all ages, grow
 37656	slowly, and, while generally solitary, are sometimes multiple. They are
 37657	most commonly met with on the shoulder, buttock, or back. In certain
 37658	situations, such as the thigh and perineum, they tend to become
 37659	pedunculated (Fig. 46).
 37660	
 37661	A fatty tumour is to be diagnosed from a cold abscess and from a cyst.
 37662	The distinguishing features of the lipoma are the tacking down and
 37663	dimpling of the overlying skin, the lobulation of the tumour, which is
 37664	recognised when it is pressed upon with the flat of the hand, and, more
 37665	reliable than either of these, the mobility, the tumour slipping away
 37666	when pressed upon at its margin.
 37667	
 37668	[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Subcutaneous Lipoma showing lobulation.]
 37669	
 37670	The prognosis is more favourable than in any other tumour as it never
 37671	changes its characters; the only reasons for its removal by operation
 37672	are its unsightliness and its probable increase in size in the course of
 37673	years. The operation consists in dividing the skin and capsule over the
 37674	tumour and shelling it out. Care must be taken that none of the outlying
 37675	lobules are left behind. If the overlying skin is damaged or closely
 37676	adherent, it should be removed along with the tumour.
 37677	
 37678	[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Pedunculated Lipoma of Buttock of forty years'
 37679	duration in a woman aet. 68.]
 37680	
 37681	_Multiple subcutaneous lipomas_ are frequently symmetrical, and in a
 37682	certain group of cases, met with chiefly in women, pain is a prominent
 37683	symptom, hence the term _adiposis dolorosa_ (Dercum). These multiple
 37684	tumours show little or no tendency to increase in size, and the pain
 37685	which attends their development does not persist.
 37686	
 37687	In the neck, axilla, and pubes a diffuse overgrowth of the subcutaneous
 37688	fat is sometimes met with, forming symmetrical tumour-like masses, known
 37689	as _diffuse lipoma_. As this is not, strictly speaking, a tumour, the
 37690	term _diffuse lipomatosis_ is to be preferred. A similar condition was
 37691	described by Jonathan Hutchinson as being met with in the domestic
 37692	animals. If causing disfigurement, the mass of fat may be removed by
 37693	operation.
 37694	
 37695	[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Diffuse Lipomatosis of Neck.]
 37696	
 37697	_Lipoma in other Situations._--The _periosteal lipoma_ is usually
 37698	congenital, and is most often met with in the hand; it forms a
 37699	projecting lobulated tumour, which, when situated in the palm, resembles
 37700	an angioma or a lymphangioma. The _subserous lipoma_ arises from the
 37701	extra-peritoneal fat in the posterior abdominal wall, in which case it
 37702	tends to grow forwards between the layers of the mesentery and to give
 37703	rise to an abdominal tumour; or it may grow from the extra-peritoneal
 37704	fat in the anterior abdominal wall and protrude from one of the hernial
 37705	openings or through an abnormal opening in the parietes, constituting a
 37706	_fatty hernia_. A _subsynovial lipoma_ grows from the fat surrounding
 37707	the synovial membrane of a joint, and projects into its interior, giving
 37708	rise to the symptoms of loose body. Lipomas are also met with growing
 37709	from the adipose connective tissue _between or in the substance of
 37710	muscles_, and, when situated beneath the deep fascia, such as the fascia
 37711	lata of the thigh, the characteristic signs are obscured and a
 37712	differential diagnosis is difficult. It may be differentiated from a
 37713	cold abscess by puncture with an exploring needle.
 37714	
 37715	[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Zanthoma of Hands in a girl aet. 14, showing
 37716	multiple subcutaneous tumours (cf. Fig. 49).
 37717	
 37718	(Sir H. J. Stiles' case.)]
 37719	
 37720	#Zanthoma# is a rare but interesting form of tumour, composed of a
 37721	fibrous and fatty tissue, containing a granular orange-yellow pigment,
 37722	resembling that of the corpus luteum. It originates in the corium and
 37723	presents two clinical varieties. In the first of these, it occurs in the
 37724	form of raised yellow patches, usually in the skin of the eyelids of
 37725	persons after middle life, and in many instances is associated with
 37726	chronic jaundice; the patches are often symmetrical, and as they
 37727	increase in size they tend to fuse with another.
 37728	
 37729	The second form occurs in children and adolescents; it may affect
 37730	several generations of the same family, and is often multiple, there
 37731	being a combination of thickened yellow patches of skin and projecting
 37732	tumours, some of which may attain a considerable size (Figs. 48 and 49).
 37733	On section, the tumour tissue presents a brilliant orange or saffron
 37734	colour.
 37735	
 37736	There is no indication for removing the tumours unless for the deformity
 37737	which they cause; exposure to the X-rays is to be preferred to
 37738	operation.
 37739	
 37740	[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Zanthoma showing Subcutaneous Tumours on
 37741	Buttocks. From same patient as Fig. 48.]
 37742	
 37743	#Chondroma.#--A chondroma is mainly composed of cartilage. Processes of
 37744	vascular connective tissue pass in between the nodules of cartilage
 37745	composing the tumour from the fibrous capsule which surrounds it. On
 37746	section it is of a greyish-blue colour and semi-translucent. The tumour
 37747	is firm and elastic in consistence, but certain portions may be densely
 37748	hard from calcification or ossification, while other portions may be
 37749	soft and fluctuating as a result of myxomatous degeneration and
 37750	liquefaction. These tumours grow slowly and painlessly, and may surround
 37751	nerves and arteries without injuring them. They may cause a deep hollow
 37752	in the bone from which they originate. All intermediate forms between
 37753	the innocent chondroma and the malignant chondro-sarcoma are met with.
 37754	Chondroma may occur in a multiple form, especially in relation to the
 37755	phalanges and metacarpal bones. When growing in the interior of a bone
 37756	it causes a spindle-shaped enlargement of the shaft, which in the case
 37757	of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may resemble the dactylitis resulting
 37758	from tubercle or syphilis. A chondroma appears as a clear area in a
 37759	skiagram.
 37760	
 37761	A _skiagram_ of a bone in which there is a chondroma shows a clear
 37762	rounded area in the position of the tumour, which must be differentiated
 37763	from similar clear areas due to other kinds of tumour, especially the
 37764	myeloma; when it has undergone calcification or ossification, it gives a
 37765	shadow as dark as bone.
 37766	
 37767	[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Chondroma growing from infraspinous fossa of
 37768	Scapula.]
 37769	
 37770	[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Chondroma of Metacarpal Bone of Thumb.]
 37771	
 37772	_Treatment._--In view of the unstable quality of the chondroma,
 37773	especially of its liability to become malignant, it should be removed as
 37774	soon as it is recognised. In those projecting from the surface of a
 37775	bone, both the tumour and its capsule should be removed. If in the
 37776	interior, a sufficient amount of the cortex should be removed to allow
 37777	of the tumour being scraped out, and care must be taken that no nodules
 37778	of cartilage are left behind. In multiple chondromas of the hand, when
 37779	the fingers are crippled and useless, exposure to the X-rays should be
 37780	given a trial, and in extreme cases the question of amputation may have
 37781	to be considered. When a cartilaginous tumour takes on active growth, it
 37782	must be treated as malignant.
 37783	
 37784	The chondromas that are met with at the ends of the long bones in
 37785	children and young adults form a group by themselves. They are usually
 37786	related to the epiphysial cartilage, and it was suggested by Virchow
 37787	that they take origin from islands of cartilage which have not been used
 37788	up in the process of ossification. They are believed to occur more
 37789	frequently in those who have suffered from rickets. They have no
 37790	malignant tendencies and tend to undergo ossification concurrently with
 37791	the epiphysial cartilage from which they take origin, and constitute
 37792	what are known as _cartilaginous exostoses_. These are sometimes met
 37793	with in a multiple form, and may occur in several generations of the
 37794	same family. They are considered in greater detail in the chapter
 37795	dealing with tumours of bone.
 37796	
 37797	Minute nodules of cartilage sometimes form in the synovial membrane of
 37798	joints and lining of tendon sheaths and bursae: they tend to become
 37799	detached from the membrane and constitute loose bodies; they also
 37800	undergo a variable amount of calcification and ossification, so as to be
 37801	visible in skiagrams. They are further considered with loose bodies in
 37802	joints.
 37803	
 37804	Cartilaginous tumours in the parotid, submaxillary gland, and testicle
 37805	belong to a class of "mixed tumours" that will be referred to later.
 37806	
 37807	#Osteoma.#--The true osteoma is composed of bony tissue, and originates
 37808	from the skeleton. Two varieties are recognised--the spongy or
 37809	cancellous, and the ivory or compact. The _spongy_ or _cancellous
 37810	osteoma_ is really an ossified chondroma, and is met with at the ends of
 37811	the long bones (Fig. 52). From the fact that it projects from the
 37812	surface of the bone it is often spoken of as an _exostosis_. It grows
 37813	slowly, and rarely causes any discomfort unless it presses upon a
 37814	nerve-trunk or upon a bursa which has developed over it. The Rontgen
 37815	rays show a dark shadow corresponding to the ossified portion of the
 37816	tumour, and continuous with that of the bone from which it is growing
 37817	(Fig. 138). Operative interference is only indicated when the tumour is
 37818	giving rise to inconvenience. It is then removed, its base or neck being
 37819	divided by means of the chisel. The multiple variety of osteoma is
 37820	considered with the diseases of bone.
 37821	
 37822	The bony outgrowth from the terminal phalanx of the great toe--known as
 37823	the _subungual exostosis_--is described and figured on p. 404. Bony
 37824	projections or "spurs" sometimes occur on the under surface of the
 37825	calcaneus, and, projecting downwards and forwards from the greater
 37826	process, cause pain on putting the heel to the ground.
 37827	
 37828	[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Cancellous Osteoma of lower end of Femur.]
 37829	
 37830	The _ivory_ or _compact osteoma_ is composed of dense bone, and usually
 37831	grows from the skull. It is generally sessile and solitary, and may grow
 37832	into the interior of the skull, into the frontal sinus, into the cavity
 37833	of the orbit or nose, or may fill up the external auditory meatus,
 37834	causing most unsightly deformity and interference with sight, breathing,
 37835	and hearing.
 37836	
 37837	Bony formations occur in _muscles and tendons_, especially at their
 37838	points of attachment to the skeleton, and are known as false exostoses;
 37839	they are described with the diseases of muscles.
 37840	
 37841	#Odontoma.#--An odontoma is composed of dental tissues in varying
 37842	proportions and different degrees of development, arising from
 37843	tooth-germs or from teeth still in process of growth (Bland Sutton).
 37844	Odontomas resemble teeth in so far that during their development they
 37845	remain hidden below the mucous membrane and give no evidence of their
 37846	existence. There then succeeds, usually between the twentieth and
 37847	twenty-fifth years, an eruptive stage, which is often attended with
 37848	suppuration, and this may be the means of drawing attention to the
 37849	tumour. Following Bland Sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be
 37850	distinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their
 37851	formation.
 37852	
 37853	The _epithelial odontoma_ is derived from persistent portions of the
 37854	epithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic
 37855	tumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible. The cystic spaces of
 37856	the tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid. These tumours have been
 37857	described by Eve under the name of multilocular cystic epithelial
 37858	tumours of the jaw.
 37859	
 37860	The _follicular odontoma_, also known as a _dentigerous cyst_, is
 37861	derived from the distension of a tooth follicle. It constitutes a cyst
 37862	containing a viscid fluid, and an imperfectly formed tooth is often
 37863	found embedded in its wall. The cyst usually forms in relation to one of
 37864	the permanent molars, and may attain considerable dimensions.
 37865	
 37866	The _fibrous odontoma_ is the result of an overgrowth of fibrous tissue
 37867	surrounding the tooth sac, which encapsulates the tooth and prevents its
 37868	eruption. The thickened tooth sac is usually mistaken for a fibrous
 37869	tumour, until, after removal, the tooth is recognised in its interior.
 37870	
 37871	_Composite Odontoma._--This is a convenient term to apply to certain
 37872	hard dental tumours which are met with in the jaws, and consist of
 37873	enamel, dentine, and cement. The tumour is to be regarded as being
 37874	derived from an abnormal growth of all the elements of a tooth germ, or
 37875	of two or more tooth germs, indiscriminately fused with one another. It
 37876	may appear in childhood, and form a smooth unyielding tumour, often of
 37877	considerable size, replacing the corresponding permanent tooth. It may
 37878	cause a purulent discharge, and in some cases it has been extruded after
 37879	sloughing of the overlying soft parts. Many examples of this variety of
 37880	odontoma, growing in the nasal cavity or in the maxillary sinus, have
 37881	been erroneously regarded as osteomas even after removal.
 37882	
 37883	On section, the tumour is usually laminated, and is seen to consist
 37884	mainly of dentine with a partial covering of enamel and cement.
 37885	
 37886	_Diagnosis._--Odontomas are often only diagnosed after removal. When
 37887	attended with suppuration, the condition has been mistaken for disease
 37888	of the jaw. Fibrous odontomas have been mistaken for sarcoma, and
 37889	portions of the maxilla removed unnecessarily. Any circumscribed tumour
 37890	of the jaw, particularly when met with in a young adult, should suggest
 37891	the possibility of an odontoma. Skiagrams often give useful information
 37892	both for diagnosis and for treatment.
 37893	
 37894	_Treatment._--The solid varieties of odontoma can usually be shelled out
 37895	after dividing the overlying soft parts. In the follicular variety, it
 37896	is usually sufficient to excise a portion of the wall, scrape out the
 37897	interior, and remove any tooth that may be present. The cavity is then
 37898	packed and allowed to heal from the bottom.
 37899	
 37900	#Fibroma.#--A fibroma is a tumour composed of fibrous connective tissue.
 37901	A distinction may be made between the _soft fibroma_, which is
 37902	comparatively rich in cells and blood vessels, and in which the fibres
 37903	are arranged loosely; and the _hard fibroma_, which is composed of
 37904	closely packed bundles of fibres often arranged in a concentric fashion
 37905	around the blood vessels. The cut surface of the soft fibroma presents a
 37906	pinkish-white, fleshy appearance, resembling the slowly growing forms of
 37907	sarcoma; that of a hard fibroma presents a dry, glistening appearance,
 37908	aptly compared to watered silk. The soft variety grows much more rapidly
 37909	than the hard. In certain fibromas--in those, for example, which grow
 37910	from the periosteum of the base of the skull and project into the
 37911	naso-pharynx--the blood vessels are dilated into sinuses and have no
 37912	proper sheaths; they therefore tend to remain open when divided, and to
 37913	bleed excessively. Transition forms between soft fibroma and sarcoma are
 37914	met with, so that in operating for their removal it is safer to take
 37915	away the capsule along with the tumour, and the patient should be kept
 37916	under observation in view of the risk of recurrence.
 37917	
 37918	The skin--especially the skin of the buttock--is one of the favourite
 37919	seats of fibroma, and it may occur in a multiple form. It is met with
 37920	also in the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue, and in the
 37921	abdominal wall, where it sometimes attains considerable dimensions.
 37922	Various forms of fibroma are met with in the mamma and are described
 37923	with diseases of that organ. The fibrous overgrowths in the skin, known
 37924	as _keloid_ and _molluscum fibrosum_, and those met with in the _sheaths
 37925	of nerves_, are described elsewhere. Fibroid tumours of the uterus are
 37926	described with myoma.
 37927	
 37928	_Diffuse fibroma_ or _Fibromatosis_, analogous to lipomatosis, is met
 37929	with in the connective tissue of the skin and sheaths of nerves, and
 37930	constitutes one form of neuro-fibromatosis; a similar change is also met
 37931	with in the stomach and colon.
 37932	
 37933	#Myxoma.#--A myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous,
 37934	semifluid consistence. The pure myxoma is extremely rare, and
 37935	clinically resembles the lipoma. Myxomatous tissue is, however,
 37936	frequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of
 37937	degeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.
 37938	Myxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the "innocent
 37939	parotid tumour." Mucous polypus of the nose, which is often described as
 37940	a myxoma, is merely a pendulous process of oedematous mucous membrane.
 37941	
 37942	[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Myeloma of Shaft of Humerus, causing
 37943	pathological fracture. (Mr. J. W. Struthers' case.)
 37944	
 37945	(The unusual site of the tumour is to be noted.)]
 37946	
 37947	#Myeloma.#--A myeloma is composed of large multinuclear giant cells
 37948	surrounded by round and spindle cells. The cut surface of the tumour
 37949	presents a deep red or maroon colour. While occasionally met with in
 37950	tendon sheaths and bursae, and is then of an orange-yellow colour, the
 37951	myeloma occurs most frequently in the cancellous tissue at the ends of
 37952	the long bones, its favourite site being the upper end of the tibia.
 37953	Although formerly classified as a sarcoma, it is the exception for it to
 37954	present malignant features, and it can usually be extirpated by local
 37955	measures without fear of recurrence. The diagnosis, X-ray appearances,
 37956	and the method of removal are considered with the diseases of bone.
 37957	Sometimes the myeloma is met with in multiple form in the skeleton, in
 37958	association with an unusual form of protein in the urine (Bence Jones).
 37959	
 37960	#Myoma.#--A myoma is composed of non-striped muscle fibres. A pure myoma
 37961	is very rare, and is met with in organs possessed of non-striped muscle,
 37962	such as the stomach, intestine, urinary bladder, and prostate. In the
 37963	uterus, which is the most common situation, these tumours contain a
 37964	considerable admixture of fibrous tissue, and are known as _fibroids_ or
 37965	_fibro-myomas_. They present on section a fasciculated appearance, which
 37966	may resemble that of a section of balls of cotton (Fig. 54). They are
 37967	encapsulated and vascular, frequently attain a large size, and may be
 37968	single or multiple. While they may occasion neither inconvenience nor
 37969	suffering, they frequently give rise to profuse haemorrhage from the
 37970	uterus, and may cause serious symptoms by pressing injuriously on the
 37971	ureters or the intestine, or by complicating pregnancy and parturition.
 37972	
 37973	The #Rhabdomyoma# is an extremely rare form of tumour, met with in the
 37974	kidney, uterus, and testicle. It contains striped muscle fibres, and is
 37975	supposed to originate from a residue of muscular tissue which has become
 37976	sequestrated during development.
 37977	
 37978	[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Fibro-myoma of Uterus.
 37979	
 37980	(Anatomical Museum, University of Edinburgh.)]
 37981	
 37982	#Glioma.#--A glioma is a tumour composed of neuroglia. It is met with
 37983	exclusively in the central nervous system, retina, and optic nerve. It
 37984	is a slowly growing, soft, ill-defined tumour, which displaces the
 37985	adjacent nerve centres and nerve tracts, and is liable to become the
 37986	seat of haemorrhage and thus to give rise to pressure symptoms resembling
 37987	apoplexy. The glioma of the retina tends to grow into the vitreous
 37988	humour and to perforate the globe. It is usually of the nature of a
 37989	glio-sarcoma and is highly malignant.
 37990	
 37991	#Endotheliomas# take origin from the endothelium of lymph vessels and
 37992	blood vessels, and serous cavities. They show great variation in type,
 37993	partly because of the number of different kinds of endothelium from
 37994	which they are derived, and partly because the new connective tissue
 37995	which is formed is liable to undergo transformation into other tissues.
 37996	They may be soft or hard, solid or cystic, diffuse or circumscribed;
 37997	they grow very slowly, and are almost always innocent, although
 37998	recurrence has been occasionally observed. Cases of multiple
 37999	endotheliomata of the skin have recently been described by Wise.
 38000	
 38001	_Angioma_, _lymphangioma_, and _neuroma_ are described with the disease
 38002	of the individual tissues.
 38003	
 38004	
 38005	MALIGNANT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS--SARCOMA
 38006	
 38007	The term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which
 38008	exhibits malignant characters. The essential structural feature is the
 38009	predominance of the cellular elements over the intercellular substance
 38010	or stroma, in which respect a sarcoma resembles the connective tissue of
 38011	the embryo. The typical sarcoma consists chiefly of immature or
 38012	embryonic connective tissue. It most frequently originates from fascia,
 38013	intermuscular connective tissue, periosteum, bone-marrow, and skin, and
 38014	forms a rounded or nodulated tumour which appears to be encapsulated,
 38015	but the capsule merely consists of the condensed surrounding tissues,
 38016	and usually contains sarcomatous elements. The consistence of the tumour
 38017	depends on the nature and amount of the stroma, and on the presence of
 38018	degenerative changes. The softer medullary forms are composed almost
 38019	exclusively of cells; while the harder forms--such as the fibro-,
 38020	chondro-, and osteo-sarcoma--are provided with an abundant stroma and
 38021	are relatively poor in cells. Degenerative changes may produce areas of
 38022	softening or liquefaction which result in the formation of cystic
 38023	cavities in the interior of the tumour. The colour depends on the amount
 38024	of blood in the tumour, and on the presence of the products of
 38025	degeneration.
 38026	
 38027	The blood vessels are usually represented by mere chinks or spaces
 38028	between the cells. This peculiarity accounts for the facility with which
 38029	haemorrhage takes place into the substance of the tumour, the persistence
 38030	of the bleeding when it is incised or ulcerates through the skin, and
 38031	the readiness with which the sarcomatous cells are carried off and
 38032	infect distant parts through the blood-stream. Sarcomas are devoid of
 38033	lymphatics, and unless originating in lymphatic structures--for example,
 38034	in the tonsil--they rarely infect the lymph glands. Minute portions of
 38035	the tumour grow into the small veins, and, becoming detached, are
 38036	transported by the blood-current to distant organs, where they are
 38037	arrested in the capillaries and give rise to secondary growths. These
 38038	are most frequently situated in the lungs, except when the primary
 38039	growth lies within the territory of the portal circulation, in which
 38040	case they occur in the liver. The secondary growths closely resemble the
 38041	parent tumour. Sarcoma may invade an adjacent vein on such a scale that
 38042	if the invading portion becomes detached it may constitute a dangerous
 38043	embolus. This may be observed in sarcoma of the kidney, the growth
 38044	taking place along the renal vein until it projects into the vena cava.
 38045	
 38046	[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Recurrent Sarcoma of Sciatic Nerve in a woman
 38047	aet. 27. Recurrence twenty months after removal of primary growth.]
 38048	
 38049	In its growth, a sarcoma compresses and destroys neighbouring parts,
 38050	surrounds vessels and nerves, and may lead to destruction of the skin,
 38051	either by invading it, or more commonly by causing sloughing from
 38052	pressure. Inflammatory and suppurative changes may take place as a
 38053	result of pyogenic infection following upon sloughing of the overlying
 38054	skin or upon an exploratory incision. Once the skin is broken the tumour
 38055	fungates through the opening. Sarcomas vary in malignancy, especially as
 38056	regards rapidity of growth and capacity for dissemination. Certain of
 38057	them, such as the so-called "recurrent fibroid of Paget," grow
 38058	comparatively slowly, and are only malignant in the sense that they tend
 38059	to recur locally after removal; others--especially the more cellular
 38060	ones--grow with extreme rapidity, and are early disseminated throughout
 38061	the body, resembling in these respects the most malignant forms of
 38062	cancer. They are usually solitary in the first instance, although
 38063	primary multiple growths are occasionally met with in the skin and in
 38064	the bones.
 38065	
 38066	Many varieties of sarcoma are recognised, according to its structural
 38067	peculiarities. Thus, in virtue of the size and character of the cells,
 38068	we have the _small round-celled_ and the _large round-celled_ sarcoma,
 38069	the _small_ and the _large spindle-celled_, the _giant-celled_ and the
 38070	_mixed-celled_ sarcoma. The _lympho-sarcoma_ presents a structure
 38071	similar to that of lymph-follicular tissue, and the _alveolar sarcoma_
 38072	an arrangement of cells in alveoli resembling that seen in cancers. When
 38073	there is a considerable amount of intercellular fibrous tissue, the
 38074	tumour is called a _fibro-sarcoma_.
 38075	
 38076	[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Fungating Sarcoma of Arm.
 38077	
 38078	(Dr. J. M'Watt's case.)]
 38079	
 38080	The term _lymphangio-sarcoma_ is applied when the cells of the tumour
 38081	are derived from the endothelium of lymph spaces and vessels. The
 38082	_angio-sarcomas_ are those in which blood vessels form a prominent
 38083	element in the structure of the tumour. They are sometimes derived from
 38084	innocent angiomas, and they may be so vascular as to pulsate and on
 38085	auscultation yield a blowing murmur like an aneurysm. The
 38086	_glio-sarcoma_, _myxo-sarcoma_, _chondro-sarcoma_, and _myo-sarcoma_ are
 38087	mixed forms which usually develop in pre-existing innocent tumours. The
 38088	_osteo-sarcoma_ is characterised by the formation in the tumour of bone,
 38089	the medullary spaces being occupied by sarcomatous cells in place of
 38090	marrow. The _osteoid sarcoma_ is characterised by the formation of a
 38091	tissue resembling bone but deficient in lime salts, and the _petrifying
 38092	sarcoma_ by the formation of calcified areas in the stroma. These
 38093	varieties, although met with chiefly in the bones, may occur in soft
 38094	tissues such as muscle, and in such organs as the mamma. The pigmented
 38095	varieties include the _chloroma_, which is of a light-green colour, and
 38096	the _melanotic sarcoma_, which is brown or black. The _psammoma_ is a
 38097	sarcoma containing a material resembling sand; it is chiefly met with in
 38098	the membranes of the brain. The _chordoma_ is a rare form of tumour
 38099	originating from the remains of the notochord in the region of the
 38100	spheno-occipital synchondrosis or in the sacro-coccygeal region.
 38101	
 38102	_Diagnosis of Sarcoma._--A sarcoma is to be differentiated from an
 38103	inflammatory swelling such as results from tubercle, actinomycosis, or
 38104	syphilis, from an innocent tumour, and from a cancer. The points on
 38105	which the diagnosis is founded are discussed with the different tissues
 38106	and organs.
 38107	
 38108	_Treatment._--The removal of the tumour by operation is the most
 38109	reliable method of treatment; in order to be successful it must be
 38110	undertaken before dissemination has taken place, and a considerable area
 38111	of healthy tissue beyond the apparent margin of the growth must be
 38112	removed, and in tumours near the surface of the body, the overlying skin
 38113	also.
 38114	
 38115	In order to prevent recurrence, a tube of _radium_, to which a silk
 38116	thread is attached, is inserted into the space from which the tumour was
 38117	removed; the thread is brought out at the drain-opening, and at the end
 38118	of a week or ten days the tube of radium is removed by pulling on the
 38119	thread. Radium causes a reaction in the tissues attended with exudation
 38120	from the vessels, for the escape of which provision must be made. If
 38121	radium is not available, the affected area is repeatedly exposed to the
 38122	action of the _X-rays_ as soon as the wound has healed. The employment
 38123	of these measures has diminished to a remarkable degree the recurrence
 38124	of sarcoma after operation.
 38125	
 38126	It will readily be understood that the less thoroughly or radically the
 38127	growth has been removed, the more do we depend upon radium or the X-rays
 38128	for bringing about a permanent cure, and that in advanced cases of
 38129	sarcoma and in cases in which, on account of their anatomical situation,
 38130	removal by operation is necessarily incomplete, the prospect of cure is
 38131	still more dependent on the use of radium or of the X-rays. Finally,
 38132	there are cases in which removal by operation is impossible, the
 38133	so-called _inoperable sarcoma_; a tube of radium, to which a silk thread
 38134	is attached, is inserted into the substance of the tumour, either
 38135	through an opening made by a large trocar, or, when necessary, by open
 38136	dissection. A second tube of radium is placed upon the skin over the
 38137	tumour and is secured there by a stitch or by a strip of plaster, thus
 38138	securing a cross-fire action of the radium rays, both from within and
 38139	without, as this is found to be much more efficacious in destroying or
 38140	inhibiting the cellular elements of the growth. The tubes of radium are
 38141	left _in situ_ for from eight to fourteen days, according to the power
 38142	of the radium employed, but are moved about every second day or so in
 38143	order that every part of the tumour may be efficiently radiated. If the
 38144	tumour shrinks in size after the use of radium and becomes operable, it
 38145	should be removed before time is given it to resume its growth. It will
 38146	depend upon the subsequent course of the disease, whether or not a
 38147	second, or it may be even a third, application of radium will be
 38148	required.
 38149	
 38150	Where neither radium nor X-rays is available or applicable, recourse may
 38151	be had to the injection of Coley's fluid, a preparation containing the
 38152	mixed toxins of the streptococcus of erysipelas and the bacillus
 38153	prodigiosus; or of selenium.
 38154	
 38155	
 38156	EPITHELIAL TUMOURS
 38157	
 38158	An excessive and erratic growth of epithelium is the essential and
 38159	distinguishing feature of these tumours. The innocent forms are the
 38160	papilloma and the adenoma; the malignant, the carcinoma or cancer.
 38161	
 38162	#Papilloma.#--A papilloma is a tumour which projects from a cutaneous or
 38163	mucous surface, and consists of a central axis of vascular fibrous
 38164	tissue with a covering of epithelium resembling that of the surface from
 38165	which the tumour grows. In the papillomas of the skin--commonly known as
 38166	_warts_--the covering consists of epidermis; in those growing from
 38167	mucous surfaces it consists of the epithelium covering the mucous
 38168	membrane. When the surface epithelium projects as filiform processes,
 38169	the tumour is called a _villous papilloma_, the best-known example of
 38170	which is met with in the urinary bladder. Papillomatous growths are
 38171	also met with in the larynx, in the ducts of the breast, and in the
 38172	interior of certain cystic tumours of the breast and of the ovary.
 38173	Although papillomas are primarily innocent, they may become the
 38174	starting-point of cancer, especially in persons past middle life and if
 38175	the papilloma has been subjected to irritation and has ulcerated. The
 38176	clinical features and treatment of the various forms of papilloma are
 38177	considered with the individual tissues and organs.
 38178	
 38179	#Adenoma.#--An adenoma is a tumour constructed on the type of, and
 38180	growing in connection with, a secreting gland. In the substance of such
 38181	glands as the mamma, parotid, thyreoid, and prostate, adenomas are met
 38182	with as encapsulated tumours. When they originate from the glands of the
 38183	skin or of a mucous membrane, they tend to project from the surface, and
 38184	form pedunculated tumours or polypi.
 38185	
 38186	Adenomas may be single or multiple, and they vary greatly in size. The
 38187	tumour is seldom composed entirely of gland tissue; it usually contains
 38188	a considerable proportion of fibrous tissue, and is then called a
 38189	_fibro-adenoma_. When it contains myxomatous tissue it is called a
 38190	_myxo-adenoma_, and when the gland spaces of the tumour become distended
 38191	with accumulated secretion, a _cystic adenoma_, the best examples of
 38192	which are met with in the mamma and ovary. A characteristic feature of
 38193	the cystic variety is the tendency the tumour tissue exhibits to project
 38194	into the interior of the cysts, constituting what are known as
 38195	_intracystic growths_. They are essentially innocent, but intracystic
 38196	growths, especially in the mamma of women over fifty, should be regarded
 38197	with suspicion and therefore should be removed on radical lines.
 38198	Transition forms between adenoma and carcinoma are also met with in the
 38199	rectum and large intestine, and these should be treated on the same
 38200	lines as cancer.
 38201	
 38202	
 38203	CARCINOMA OR CANCER
 38204	
 38205	A cancer is a malignant tumour which originates in epithelium. The
 38206	cancer cells are derived by proliferation from already existing
 38207	epithelium, and they invade the sub-epithelial connective tissue in the
 38208	form of simple or branching columns. These columns are enclosed in
 38209	spaces--termed alveoli--which are probably dilated lymph spaces, and
 38210	which communicate freely with the lymph vessels. The cells composing the
 38211	columns and filling the alveoli vary with the character of the
 38212	epithelium in which the cancer originates. The malignancy of cancer
 38213	depends on the tendency which the epithelium has of invading the tissues
 38214	in its neighbourhood, and on the capacity of the cells, when
 38215	transported elsewhere by the lymph or blood-stream, of giving rise to
 38216	secondary growths.
 38217	
 38218	Cancer may arise on any surface covered by epithelium or in any of the
 38219	secreting glands of the body, but it is much more common in some
 38220	situations than in others. It is frequently met with, for example, in
 38221	the skin, in the stomach and large intestine, in the breast, the uterus,
 38222	and the external genitals; less frequently in the gall-bladder, larynx,
 38223	thyreoid, prostate, and urinary bladder.
 38224	
 38225	Tissues appear to be most liable to cancer when, having attained
 38226	maturity, they enter upon the phase of decadence or involution, and this
 38227	phase is reached by different tissues at different periods. It is not so
 38228	much, therefore, the age of the person in whom it occurs, as the age of
 38229	the tissue in which it arises, that determines the maximum incidence of
 38230	cancer. Cancer of the stomach appears and attains a maximum frequency
 38231	earlier than cancer of the skin; cancer of the uterus and mamma is more
 38232	frequent towards the decline of reproductive activity than in the later
 38233	years of life; rectal cancer is not infrequently met with during the
 38234	second and third decades. There is evidence that the irritation caused
 38235	by alcohol and tobacco plays a part in the causation of cancer, in the
 38236	fact that a large proportion of those who become the subjects of cancer
 38237	of the mouth are excessive drinkers and smokers.
 38238	
 38239	A cancer may appear as a papillary growth on a mucous or a skin surface,
 38240	as a nodule in the substance of an organ, or as a diffuse thickening of
 38241	a tubular organ such as the stomach or intestine. The absence of
 38242	definition in cancerous tumours explains the difficulty of completely
 38243	removing them by surgical measures, and has led to the practice of
 38244	complete extirpation of cancerous organs wherever this is possible. The
 38245	boundaries of the affected organ, moreover, are frequently transgressed
 38246	by the disease, and the epithelial infiltration implicates the
 38247	surrounding parts. In cancer of the breast, for example, the disease
 38248	often extends to the adjacent skin, fat, and muscle; in cancer of the
 38249	lip or tongue, to the mandible; in cancer of the uterus or intestine, to
 38250	the investing peritoneum.
 38251	
 38252	In addition to its tendency to infiltrate adjacent tissues and organs,
 38253	cancer is also liable to give rise to _secondary growths_. These are
 38254	most often met with in the nearest lymph glands; those in the neck, for
 38255	example, becoming infected from cancer of the lip, tongue, or throat;
 38256	those in the axilla, from cancer of the breast; those along the
 38257	curvatures of the stomach, from cancer of the pylorus; and those in the
 38258	groin, from cancer of the external genitals. In lymph vessels the cancer
 38259	cells may merely accumulate so as to fill the lumen and form indurated
 38260	cords, or they may proliferate and give rise to secondary nodules along
 38261	the course of the vessels. When the lymphatic network in the skin is
 38262	diffusely infected, the appearance is either that of a multitude of
 38263	secondary nodules or of a diffuse thickening, so that the skin comes to
 38264	resemble coarse leather. On the wall of the chest this condition is
 38265	known as _cancer en cuirasse_. Although the cancer cells constantly
 38266	attack the walls of the adjacent veins and spread into their interior at
 38267	a comparatively early period, secondary growths due to dissemination by
 38268	the blood-stream rarely show themselves clinically until late in the
 38269	course of the disease. It is probable that many of the cancer cells
 38270	which are carried away in the blood or lymph stream undergo necrosis and
 38271	fail to give rise to secondary growths. Secondary growths present a
 38272	faithful reproduction of the structure of the primary tumour. Apart from
 38273	the lymph glands, the chief seats of secondary growths are the liver,
 38274	lungs, serous membranes, and bone marrow.
 38275	
 38276	It is generally believed that the secondary growths in cancer that
 38277	develop at a distance from the primary tumour, those, for example, in
 38278	the medullary canal of the femur or in the diploe of the skull occurring
 38279	in advanced cases of cancer of the breast, are the result of
 38280	dissemination of cancer cells by way of the blood-stream and are to be
 38281	regarded as emboli. Sampson Handley disagrees with this view; he
 38282	believes that the dissemination is accomplished in a more subtle way,
 38283	namely, by the actual growth of cancer cells along the finer vessels of
 38284	the lymph plexuses that ramify in the deep fascia, a method of spread
 38285	which he calls _permeation_. It is maintained also that permeation
 38286	occurs as readily against the lymph stream as with it. He compares the
 38287	spread of cancer to that of an invisible annular ringworm. The growing
 38288	edge extends in a wider and wider circle, within which a healing process
 38289	may occur, so that the area of permeation is a ring, rather than a disc.
 38290	Healing occurs by a process of "peri-lymphatic fibrosis," but as the
 38291	natural process of healing may fail at isolated points, nodules of
 38292	cancer appear, which, although apparently separate from the primary
 38293	growth, have developed in continuity with it, peri-lymphatic fibrosis
 38294	having destroyed the cancer chain connecting the nodule with the primary
 38295	growth. This centrifugal spread of cancer is clearly seen in the
 38296	distribution of the subcutaneous secondary nodules so frequently met
 38297	with in the late stages of mammary cancer. The area within which the
 38298	secondary nodules occur is a circle of continually increasing diameter
 38299	with the primary growth in the centre.
 38300	
 38301	In the rare cases in which the skin of the greater part of the body is
 38302	affected, the nodules rarely appear below the level of the deltoid or
 38303	the middle third of the thigh, the patient dying before the spread can
 38304	reach the distal portions of the limbs.
 38305	
 38306	Handley argues against the embolic origin of the metastases in the bones
 38307	because of the rarity of these in the bones of the distal parts of the
 38308	limbs, because of the fact that secondary cancer of the femur nearly
 38309	always commences in the upper third of the shaft, which harmonises with
 38310	the intimate connection of the deep fascia with the periosteum over the
 38311	great trochanter, thus favouring invasion of the bone marrow when
 38312	permeation has spread thus far. He claims support for the permeation
 38313	theory from the fact that the humerus is rarely involved below the
 38314	insertion of the deltoid, and that spontaneous fracture of the femur is
 38315	three times more common on the side on which the breast cancer is
 38316	situated.
 38317	
 38318	The tumour tissue may undergo necrosis, and when the overlying skin or
 38319	mucous membrane gives way an ulcer is formed. The margins of a
 38320	_cancerous ulcer_ (Fig. 57) are made up of tumour tissue which has not
 38321	broken down. Usually they are irregular, nodularly thickened or
 38322	indurated; sometimes they are raised and crater-like. The floor of the
 38323	ulcer is smooth and glazed, or occupied by necrosed tissue, and the
 38324	discharge is watery and blood-stained, and as a result of putrefactive
 38325	changes may become offensive. Haemorrhage is rarely a prominent feature,
 38326	but discharge of blood may constitute a symptom of considerable
 38327	diagnostic importance in cancer of internal organs such as the rectum,
 38328	the bladder, or the uterus.
 38329	
 38330	[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Carcinoma of Breast with Cancerous Ulcer.]
 38331	
 38332	_The Contagiousness of Cancer._--A limited number of cases are on record
 38333	in which a cancer appears to have been transferred by contact, as from
 38334	the lower to the upper lip, from one labium majus to the other, from the
 38335	tongue to the cheek, and from one vocal cord to the other; these being
 38336	all examples of cancer involving surfaces which are constantly or
 38337	frequently in contact. The transference of cancer from one human being
 38338	to another, whether by accident, as in the case of a surgeon wounding
 38339	his finger while operating for cancer, or by the deliberate introduction
 38340	of a portion of cancerous tumour into the tissues, has never been known
 38341	to occur. It is by no means infrequent, however, that when recurrence
 38342	takes place after an operation for the removal of cancer, the recurrent
 38343	nodules make their appearance in the main scar or in the scars of
 38344	stitches in its neighbourhood. In the lower animals the grafting of
 38345	cancer only succeeds in animals of the same species; for example, a
 38346	cancer taken from a mouse will not grow in the tissues of a rat, but
 38347	only in a mouse of the same variety as that from which the graft was
 38348	taken.
 38349	
 38350	While cancer cannot be regarded as either contagious or infectious, it
 38351	is important to bear in mind the possibility of infection of a wound
 38352	with cancer when operating for the disease. A cancer should not be cut
 38353	into unless this is essential for purposes of diagnosis, and the wound
 38354	made for exploration should be tightly closed by stitches before the
 38355	curative operation is proceeded with; the instruments used for the
 38356	exploration must not be used again until they have been boiled. The
 38357	greatest care should be taken that a cancer which has softened or broken
 38358	down is not opened into during the operation.
 38359	
 38360	Investigations regarding the cause of cancer have been prosecuted with
 38361	great energy during recent years, but as yet without positive result. It
 38362	is recognised that there are a number of conditions which favour the
 38363	development of cancer, such as prolonged irritation, and a considerable
 38364	number of cases have been recorded in which cancer of the skin of the
 38365	hands has followed prolonged and repeated exposure to the Rontgen rays.
 38366	
 38367	_The Alleged Increase of Cancer._--Regarding the alleged increase of
 38368	cancer, it may be pointed out that it is impossible to ascertain how
 38369	much of the apparent increase is due to more accurate diagnosis and
 38370	improved registration. It is probable also that some increase has taken
 38371	place in consequence of the increased average duration of life; a larger
 38372	proportion of persons now reach the age at which cancer is frequent.
 38373	
 38374	_The prognosis_ largely depends on the variety of cancer and on its
 38375	situation. Certain varieties--such as the atrophic cancer of the breast
 38376	which occurs in old people, and some forms of cancer in the rectum--are
 38377	so indolent in their progress that they can scarcely be said to shorten
 38378	life; while others--such as the softer varieties of mammary cancer
 38379	occurring in young women--are among the most malignant of tumours. The
 38380	mode in which cancer causes death depends to a large extent upon its
 38381	situation. In the gullet, for example, it usually causes death by
 38382	starvation; in the larynx or thyreoid, by suffocation; in the intestine,
 38383	by obstruction of the bowels; in the uterus, prostate, and bladder, by
 38384	haemorrhage or by implication of the ureters and kidneys. Independently
 38385	of their situation, however, cancers frequently cause death by giving
 38386	rise to a progressive impairment of health known as the _cancerous
 38387	cachexia_, a condition which is due to the continued absorption of
 38388	poisonous products from the tumour. The patient loses appetite, becomes
 38389	emaciated, pale, and feverish, and gradually loses strength until he
 38390	dies. In many cases, especially those in which ulceration has occurred,
 38391	the addition of pyogenic infection may also be concerned in the failure
 38392	of health.
 38393	
 38394	_Treatment._--Removal by surgical means affords the best prospect of
 38395	cure. If carcinomatous disease is to be rooted out, its mode of spread
 38396	by means of the lymph vessels must be borne in mind, and as this occurs
 38397	at an early stage, and is not evident on examination, a wide area must
 38398	be included in the operation. The organ from which the original growth
 38399	springs should, if practicable, be altogether removed, because its lymph
 38400	vessels generally communicate freely with each other, and secondary
 38401	deposits have probably already taken place in various parts of it. In
 38402	addition, the nearest chain of lymph glands must also be removed, even
 38403	though they may not be noticeably enlarged, and in some cases--in cancer
 38404	of the breast, for example--the intervening lymph vessels should be
 38405	removed at the same time.
 38406	
 38407	The treatment of cancer by other than operative methods has received a
 38408	great deal of attention within recent years, and many agents have been
 38409	put to the test, _e.g._ colloidal suspensions of selenium, but without
 38410	any positive results. Most benefit has resulted from the use of radium
 38411	and of the X-rays, and one or other should be employed as a routine
 38412	measure after every operation for cancer.
 38413	
 38414	It has been demonstrated that cancer cells are more sensitive to radium
 38415	and to the Rontgen rays than the normal cells of the body, and are more
 38416	easily killed. The effect varies a good deal with the nature and seat of
 38417	the tumour. In rodent cancers of the skin, for example, both radium and
 38418	X-ray treatment are very successful, and are to be preferred to
 38419	operation because they yield a better cosmetic result. While small
 38420	epitheliomas of the skin may be cured by means of the rays, they are not
 38421	so amenable as rodent cancers.
 38422	
 38423	Cancers of mucous membranes are less amenable to ray treatment because
 38424	they are less circumscribed and are difficult of access. In cancers
 38425	under the skin, the Rontgen rays are less efficient; if radium is
 38426	employed, the tube containing it should be inserted into the substance
 38427	of the tumour after the method described in connection with sarcoma--and
 38428	another tube should be placed on the overlying skin.
 38429	
 38430	In the employment of X-rays and of radium in the treatment of cancer,
 38431	experience is required, not only to obtain the maximum effect of the
 38432	rays, but to avoid damage to the adjacent and overlying tissues.
 38433	
 38434	Ray treatment is not to be looked upon as a rival but as a powerful
 38435	supplement to the operative treatment of cancer.
 38436	
 38437	
 38438	VARIETIES OF CANCER
 38439	
 38440	The varieties of cancer are distinguished according to the character and
 38441	arrangement of the epithelial cells.
 38442	
 38443	The _squamous epithelial cancer_ or _epithelioma_ originates from a
 38444	surface covered by squamous epithelium, such as the skin, or the mucous
 38445	membrane of the mouth, gullet, or larynx. The cancer cells retain the
 38446	characters of squamous epithelium, and, being confined within the lymph
 38447	spaces of the sub-epithelial connective tissue, become compressed and
 38448	undergo a horny change. This results in the formation of concentrically
 38449	laminated masses known as cell nests.
 38450	
 38451	The clinical features are those of a slowly growing indurated tumour,
 38452	which nearly always ulcerates; there is a characteristic induration of
 38453	the edges and floor of the ulcer, and its surface is often covered with
 38454	warty or cauliflower-like outgrowths (Fig. 58). The infection of the
 38455	lymph glands is early and constant, and constitutes the most dangerous
 38456	feature of the disease; the secondary growths in the glands exhibit the
 38457	characteristic induration, and may themselves break down and lead to the
 38458	formation of ulcers.
 38459	
 38460	[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Epithelioma of Lip.]
 38461	
 38462	Epithelioma frequently originates in long-standing ulcers or sinuses,
 38463	and in scars, and probably results from the displacement and
 38464	sequestration of epithelial cells during the process of cicatrisation.
 38465	
 38466	The _columnar epithelial cancer_ or _columnar epithelioma_ originates in
 38467	mucous membranes covered with columnar epithelium, and is chiefly met
 38468	with in the stomach and intestine. As it resembles an adenoma in
 38469	structure it is sometimes described as a _malignant adenoma_. Its
 38470	malignancy is shown by the proliferating epithelium invading the other
 38471	coats of the stomach or intestine, and by the development of secondary
 38472	growths.
 38473	
 38474	_Glandular carcinoma_ originates in organs such as the breast, and in
 38475	the glands of mucous membranes and skin. The epithelial cells are not
 38476	arranged on any definite plan, but are closely packed in irregularly
 38477	shaped alveoli. If the alveoli are large and the intervening stroma is
 38478	scanty and delicate, the tumour is soft and brain-like, and is described
 38479	as a _medullary_ or _encephaloid cancer_. If the alveoli are small and
 38480	the intervening stroma is abundant and composed of dense fibrous tissue,
 38481	the tumour is hard, and is known as a _scirrhous cancer_--a form which
 38482	is most frequently met with in the breast. If the cells undergo
 38483	degeneration and absorption and the stroma contracts, the tumour becomes
 38484	still harder, and tends to shrink and to draw in the surrounding parts,
 38485	leading, in the breast, to retraction of the nipple and overlying skin,
 38486	and in the stomach and colon to narrowing of the lumen. When the cells
 38487	of the tumour undergo colloid degeneration, a _colloid cancer_ results;
 38488	if the degeneration is complete, as may occur in the breast, the
 38489	malignancy is thereby greatly diminished; if only partial, as is more
 38490	common in rectal cancer, the malignancy is not appreciably affected.
 38491	Melanin pigment is formed in relation to the cells and stroma of certain
 38492	epithelial tumours, giving rise to _melanotic cancer_, one of the most
 38493	malignant of all new growths. Cyst-like spaces may form in the tumour by
 38494	the accumulation of the secretion of the epithelial cells, or as a
 38495	result of their degeneration--_cystic carcinoma_. This is met with
 38496	chiefly in the breast and ovary, and the tumour resembles the cystic
 38497	adenoma, but it tends to infect its surroundings and gives rise to
 38498	secondary growths.
 38499	
 38500	_Rodent cancer_ originates in the glands of the skin, and presents a
 38501	special tendency to break down and ulcerate on the surface (Figs. 102
 38502	and 103). It almost never infects the lymph glands.
 38503	
 38504	
 38505	DERMOIDS
 38506	
 38507	A dermoid is a tumour containing skin or mucous membrane, occurring in a
 38508	situation where these tissues are not met under normal conditions.
 38509	
 38510	The _skin dermoid_, or _derma-cyst_ as it has been called by Askanazy,
 38511	arises from a portion of epiblast, which has become sequestrated during
 38512	the process of coalescence of two cutaneous surfaces in development.
 38513	This form is therefore most frequently met with on the face and neck in
 38514	the situations which correspond to the various clefts and fissures of
 38515	the embryo. It occurs also on the trunk in situations where the lateral
 38516	halves of the body coalesce during development. Such a dermoid usually
 38517	takes the form of a globular cyst, the wall of which consists of skin,
 38518	and the contents of turbid fluid containing desquamated epithelium, fat
 38519	droplets, cholestrol crystals, and detached hairs. Delicate hairs may
 38520	also be found projecting from the epithelial lining of the cyst.
 38521	
 38522	Faulty coalescence of the cutaneous covering of the back occurs most
 38523	frequently over the lower sacral vertebrae, giving rise to small
 38524	congenital recesses, known as post-anal dimples and coccygeal sinuses.
 38525	These recesses are lined with skin, which is furnished with hairs,
 38526	sebaceous and sweat glands. If the external orifice becomes occluded,
 38527	there results a dermoid cyst.
 38528	
 38529	_Tubulo-dermoids_ arise from embryonic ducts and passages that are
 38530	normally obliterated at birth, for example, _lingual dermoids_ develop
 38531	in relation to the thyreo-glossal duct; _rectal and post-rectal_
 38532	dermoids to the post-anal gut; and _branchial dermoids_ in relation to
 38533	the branchial clefts. Tubulo-dermoids present the same structure as skin
 38534	dermoids, save that mucous membrane takes the place of skin in the wall
 38535	of the cyst, and the contents consist of the pent-up secretion of mucous
 38536	glands.
 38537	
 38538	_Clinical Features._--Although dermoids are of congenital origin, they
 38539	are rarely evident at birth, and may not give rise to visible tumours
 38540	until puberty, when the skin and its appendages become more active, or
 38541	not till adult life. Superficial dermoids, such as those met with at the
 38542	outer angle of the orbit, form rounded, definitely limited tumours over
 38543	which the skin is freely movable. They are usually adherent to the
 38544	deeper parts, and when situated over the skull may be lodged in a
 38545	depression or actual gap in the bone. Sometimes the cyst becomes
 38546	infected and suppurates, and finally ruptures on the surface. This may
 38547	lead to a natural cure, or a persistent sinus may form. Dermoids more
 38548	deeply placed, such as those within the thorax, or those situated
 38549	between the rectum and sacrum, give rise to difficulty in diagnosis,
 38550	even with the help of the X-rays, and their nature is seldom recognised
 38551	until the escape of the contents--particularly hairs--supplies the clue.
 38552	The literature of dermoid cysts is full of accounts of puzzling tumours
 38553	met with in all sorts of situations.
 38554	
 38555	The treatment is to remove the cyst. When it is impossible to remove the
 38556	whole of the lining membrane by dissection, the portion that is left
 38557	should be destroyed with the cautery.
 38558	
 38559	_Ovarian Dermoids._--Dermoids are not uncommon in the ovary (Fig. 59).
 38560	They usually take the form of unilocular or multilocular cysts, the
 38561	wall of which contains skin, mucous membrane, hair follicles, sebaceous,
 38562	sweat, and mucous glands, nails, teeth, nipples, and mammary glands. The
 38563	cavity of the cyst usually contains a pultaceous mixture of shed
 38564	epithelium, fluid fat, and hair. If the cyst ruptures, the epithelial
 38565	elements are diffused over the peritoneum, and may give rise to
 38566	secondary dermoids.
 38567	
 38568	[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Dermoid Cyst of Ovary showing Teeth in its
 38569	interior.]
 38570	
 38571	The ovarian dermoid appears clinically as an abdominal or pelvic tumour
 38572	provided with a pedicle; if the pedicle becomes twisted, the tumour
 38573	undergoes strangulation, an event which is attended with urgent
 38574	symptoms, not unlike those of strangulated hernia.
 38575	
 38576	The treatment consists in removing the tumour by laparotomy.
 38577	
 38578	#Teratoma.#--A teratoma is believed to result from partial dichotomy or
 38579	cleavage of the trunk axis of the embryo, and is found exclusively in
 38580	connection with the skull and vertebral column. It may take the form of
 38581	a monstrosity such as conjoined twins or a parasitic foetus, but more
 38582	commonly it is met with as an irregularly shaped tumour, usually growing
 38583	from the sacrum. On dissection, such a tumour is found to contain a
 38584	curious mixture of tissues--bones, skin, and portions of viscera, such
 38585	as the intestine or liver. The question of the removal of the tumour
 38586	requires to be considered in relation to the conditions present in each
 38587	individual case.
 38588	
 38589	
 38590	CYSTS[3]
 38591	
 38592	[3] Cysts which form in relation to new-growths have been considered
 38593	with tumours.
 38594	
 38595	Cysts are rounded sacs, the wall being composed of fibrous tissue lined
 38596	by epithelium or endothelium; the contents are fluid or semi-solid, and
 38597	vary in character according to the tissue in which the cyst has
 38598	originated.
 38599	
 38600	_Retention and Exudation Cysts._--_Retention cysts_ develop when the
 38601	duct of a secreting gland is partly obstructed; the secretion
 38602	accumulates, and the gland and its duct become distended into a cyst.
 38603	They are met with in the mamma and in the salivary glands. Sebaceous
 38604	cysts or wens are described with diseases of the skin. _Exudation cysts_
 38605	arise from the distension of cavities which are not provided with
 38606	excretory ducts, such as those in the thyreoid.
 38607	
 38608	_Implantation cysts_ are caused by the accidental transference of
 38609	portions of the epidermis into the underlying connective tissue, as may
 38610	occur in wounds by needles, awls, forks, or thorns. The implanted
 38611	epidermis proliferates and forms a small cyst. They are met with chiefly
 38612	on the palmar aspect of the fingers, and vary in size from a split pea
 38613	to a cherry. The treatment consists in removing them by dissection.
 38614	
 38615	_Parasitic cysts_ are produced by the growth within the tissues of
 38616	cyst-forming parasites, the best known being the taenia echinococcus,
 38617	which gives rise to the _hydatid cyst_. The liver is by far the most
 38618	common site of hydatid cysts in the human subject.
 38619	
 38620	With regard to the further life-history of hydatids, the living elements
 38621	of the cyst may die and degenerate, or the cyst may increase in size
 38622	until it ruptures. As a result of pyogenic infection the cyst may be
 38623	converted into an abscess.
 38624	
 38625	The _clinical features_ of hydatids vary so much with their situation
 38626	and size, that they are best discussed with the individual organs. In
 38627	general it may be said that there is a slow formation of a globular,
 38628	elastic, fluctuating, painless swelling. Fluctuation is detected when
 38629	the cyst approaches the surface, and it is then also that percussion
 38630	may elicit the "hydatid thrill" or fremitus. This thrill is not often
 38631	obtainable, and in any case is not pathognomonic of hydatids, as it may
 38632	be elicited in ascites and in other abdominal cysts. Pressure of the
 38633	cyst upon adjacent structures, and the occurrence of suppuration, are
 38634	attended with characteristic clinical features.
 38635	
 38636	The _diagnosis_ of hydatids will be considered with the individual
 38637	organs. The disease is more common in certain parts of Australia and in
 38638	Shetland and Iceland than in countries where the association of dogs in
 38639	the domestic life of the inhabitants is less intimate. Pfeiler, who has
 38640	worked at the _serum diagnosis of hydatid disease_, regards the
 38641	complement deviation method as the most reliable; he believes that a
 38642	positive reaction may almost be regarded as absolutely diagnostic of an
 38643	echinococcal lesion.
 38644	
 38645	The _treatment_ is to excise the cyst completely, or to inject into it a
 38646	1 per cent. solution of formalin. In operating upon hydatids the utmost
 38647	care must be taken to avoid leakage of the contents of the cyst, as
 38648	these may readily disseminate the infection.
 38649	
 38650	A _blood cyst_ or haematoma results from the encapsulation of
 38651	extravasated blood in the tissues, from haemorrhage taking place into a
 38652	preformed cyst, or from the saccular pouching of a varicose vein.
 38653	
 38654	A _lymph cyst_ usually results from a contusion in which the skin is
 38655	forcibly displaced from the subjacent tissues, and lymph vessels are
 38656	thereby torn across. The cyst is usually situated between the skin and
 38657	fascia, and contains clear or blood-stained serum. At first it is lax
 38658	and fluctuates readily, later it becomes larger and more tense. The
 38659	treatment consists in drawing off the contents through a hollow needle
 38660	and applying firm pressure. Apart from injury, lymph cysts are met with
 38661	as the result of the distension of lymph spaces and vessels
 38662	(_lymphangiectasis_); and in lymphangiomas, of which the best-known
 38663	example is the cystic hygroma or hydrocele of the neck.
 38664	
 38665	
 38666	GANGLION
 38667	
 38668	This term is applied to a cyst filled with a clear colourless jelly or
 38669	colloid material, met with in the vicinity of a joint or tendon sheath.
 38670	
 38671	The commonest variety--the _carpal ganglion_--popularly known as a
 38672	sprained sinew--is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on
 38673	the dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (Fig. 60).
 38674	It is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this
 38675	region, and may be connected with one or other of the extensor tendons.
 38676	The skin and fascia are movable over the cyst. The cyst varies in size
 38677	from a pea to a pigeon's egg, and usually attains its maximum size
 38678	within a few months and then remains stationary. It becomes tense and
 38679	prominent when the hand is flexed towards the palm. Its appearance is
 38680	usually ascribed to some strain of the wrist--for example, in girls
 38681	learning gymnastics. It may cause no symptoms or it may interfere with
 38682	the use of the hand, especially in grasping movements and when the hand
 38683	is dorsiflexed. In girls it may give rise to pain which shoots up the
 38684	arm. Ganglia are also met with on the dorsum of the metacarpus and on
 38685	the palmar aspect of the wrist.
 38686	
 38687	[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Carpal Ganglion in a woman aet. 25.]
 38688	
 38689	The _tarsal ganglion_ is situated on the dorsum of the foot over one or
 38690	other of the intertarsal joints. It is usually smaller, flatter, and
 38691	more tense than that met with over the wrist, so that it is sometimes
 38692	mistaken for a bony tumour. It rarely causes symptoms, unless so
 38693	situated as to be pressed upon by the boot.
 38694	
 38695	_Ganglia in the region of the knee_ are usually situated over the
 38696	interval between the femur and tibia, most often on the lateral aspect
 38697	of the joint in front of the tendon of the biceps (Fig. 61). The
 38698	swelling, which may attain the size of half a walnut, is tense and hard
 38699	when the knee is extended, and becomes softer and more prominent when it
 38700	is flexed. They are met with in young adults who follow laborious
 38701	occupations or who indulge in athletics, and they cause stiffness,
 38702	discomfort, and impairment of the use of the limb. A ganglion is
 38703	sometimes met with on the median aspect of the head of the metatarsal
 38704	bone of the great toe and may be the cause of considerable suffering; it
 38705	is indistinguishable from the thickened and enlarged bursa so commonly
 38706	present in this situation in the condition known as bunion.
 38707	
 38708	[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Ganglion on lateral aspect of Knee in a young
 38709	woman.]
 38710	
 38711	Ganglionic cysts are met with in other situations than those mentioned,
 38712	but they are so rare as not to require separate description.
 38713	
 38714	Ganglia are to be diagnosed by their situation and physical characters;
 38715	enlarged bursae, synovial cysts, and new-growths are the swellings most
 38716	likely to be mistaken for them. The diagnosis is sometimes only cleared
 38717	up by withdrawing the clear, jelly-like contents through a hollow
 38718	needle.
 38719	
 38720	_Pathological Anatomy._--The wall of the cyst is composed of fibrous
 38721	tissue closely adherent to or fused with the surrounding tissues, so
 38722	that it cannot be shelled out. There is no endothelial lining, and the
 38723	fibrous tissue of the wall is in immediate contact with the colloid
 38724	material in the interior, which appears to be derived by a process of
 38725	degeneration from the surrounding connective tissue. In the region of
 38726	the knee the ganglion is usually multilocular, and consists of a
 38727	meshwork of fibrous tissue, the meshes of which are occupied by colloid
 38728	material.
 38729	
 38730	It is often stated that a ganglion originates from a hernial protrusion
 38731	of the synovial membrane of a joint or tendon sheath. We have not been
 38732	able to demonstrate any communication between the cavity of the cyst
 38733	and that of an adjacent tendon sheath or joint. It is possible, however,
 38734	that the cyst may originate from a minute portion of synovial membrane
 38735	being protruded and strangulated so that it becomes disconnected from
 38736	that to which it originally belonged; it may then degenerate and give
 38737	rise to colloid material, which accumulates and forms a cyst. Ledderhose
 38738	and others regard ganglia as entirely new formations in the
 38739	peri-articular tissues, resulting from colloid degeneration of the
 38740	fibrous tissue of the capsular ligament, occurring at first in numerous
 38741	small areas which later coalesce. Ganglia are probably, therefore, of
 38742	the nature of degeneration cysts arising in the capsule of joints, in
 38743	tendons, and in their sheaths.
 38744	
 38745	_Treatment._--A ganglion can usually be got rid of by a modification of
 38746	the old-fashioned seton. The skin and cyst wall are transfixed by a
 38747	stout needle carrying a double thread of silkworm gut; some of the
 38748	colourless jelly escapes from the punctures; the ends of the thread are
 38749	tied and cut short, and a dressing is applied. A week later the threads
 38750	are removed and the minute punctures are sealed with collodion. The
 38751	action of the threads is to convert the cyst wall into granulation
 38752	tissue, which undergoes the usual conversion into scar tissue. If the
 38753	cyst re-forms, it should be removed by open dissection under local
 38754	anaesthesia. Puncture with a tenotomy knife and scraping the interior,
 38755	and the injection of irritants, are alternative, but less satisfactory,
 38756	methods of treatment.
 38757	
 38758	_Ganglia_ in the substance of _tendons_ are rare. The diagnosis rests on
 38759	the observation that the small tumour is cystic, and that it follows the
 38760	movements of the tendon. The cyst is at first multiple, but the
 38761	partitions disappear, and the spaces are thrown into one. The tendon is
 38762	so weakened that it readily ruptures. The best treatment is to resect
 38763	the affected segment of tendon.
 38764	
 38765	The so-called "compound palmar ganglion" is a tuberculous disease of the
 38766	tendon sheaths, and is described with diseases of tendon sheaths.

 38783	
 38784	CONTUSIONS
 38785	
 38786	A contusion or bruise is a laceration of the subcutaneous soft tissues,
 38787	without solution of continuity of the skin. When the integument gives
 38788	way at the same time, a _contused-wound_ results. Bruising occurs when
 38789	force is applied to a part by means of a blunt object, whether as a
 38790	direct blow, a crush, or a grazing form of violence. If the force acts
 38791	at right angles to the part, it tends to produce localised lesions which
 38792	extend deeply; while, if it acts obliquely, it gives rise to lesions
 38793	which are more diffuse, but comparatively superficial. It is well to
 38794	remember that those who suffer from scurvy, or haemophilia (bleeders),
 38795	and fat and anaemic females, are liable to be bruised by comparatively
 38796	trivial injuries.
 38797	
 38798	_Clinical Features._--The less severe forms of contusion are associated
 38799	with _ecchymosis_, numerous minute and discrete punctate haemorrhages
 38800	being scattered through the superficial layers of the skin, which is
 38801	slightly oedematous. The effused blood is soon reabsorbed.
 38802	
 38803	The more severe forms are attended with _extravasation_, the
 38804	extravasated blood being widely diffused through the cellular tissue of
 38805	the part, especially where this is loose and lax, as in the region of
 38806	the orbit, the scrotum and perineum, and on the chest wall. A blue or
 38807	bluish-black discoloration occurs in patches, varying in size and depth
 38808	with the degree of force which produced the injury, and in shape with
 38809	the instrument employed. It is most intense in regions where the skin is
 38810	naturally thin and pigmented. In parts where the extravasated blood is
 38811	only separated from the oxygen of the air by a thin layer of epidermis
 38812	or by a mucous membrane, it retains its bright arterial colour. These
 38813	points are often well illustrated in cases of black eye, where the blood
 38814	effused under the conjunctiva is bright red, while that in the eyelids
 38815	is almost black. In severe contusions associated with great tension of
 38816	the skin--for example, over the front of the tibia or around the
 38817	ankle--blisters often form on the surface and constitute a possible
 38818	avenue of infection. When deeply situated, the blood tends to spread
 38819	along the lines of least resistance, partly under the influence of
 38820	gravity, passing under fasciae, between muscles, along the sheaths of
 38821	vessels, or in connective-tissue spaces, so that it may only reach the
 38822	surface after some time, and at a considerable distance from the seat of
 38823	injury. This fact is sometimes of importance in diagnosis, as, for
 38824	example, in certain fractures of the base of the skull, where
 38825	discoloration appears under the conjunctiva or behind the mastoid
 38826	process some days after the accident.
 38827	
 38828	Blood extravasated deeply in the tissues gives rise to a firm,
 38829	resistant, doughy swelling, in which there may be elicited on deep
 38830	palpation a peculiar sensation, not unlike the crepitus of fracture.
 38831	
 38832	It frequently happens that, from the tearing of lymph vessels, serous
 38833	fluid is extravasated, and a _lymphatic_ or _serous cyst_ may form.
 38834	
 38835	In all contusions accompanied by extravasation, there is marked swelling
 38836	of the area involved, as well as pain and tenderness. The temperature
 38837	may rise to 101 o F., or, in the large extravasations that occur in
 38838	bleeders, even higher--a form of aseptic fever. The degree of shock is
 38839	variable, but sudden syncope frequently results from severe bruises of
 38840	the testicle, abdomen, or head, and occasionally marked nervous
 38841	depression follows these injuries.
 38842	
 38843	Contusion of muscles or nerves may produce partial atrophy and paresis,
 38844	as is often seen after injuries in the region of the shoulder.
 38845	
 38846	In alcoholic or other debilitated patients, suppuration is liable to
 38847	ensue in bruised parts, infection taking place from cocci circulating in
 38848	the blood, or through the overlying skin.
 38849	
 38850	_Terminations of Contusions._--The usual termination is a complete
 38851	return to the normal, some of the extravasated blood being organised,
 38852	but most of it being reabsorbed. During the process characteristic
 38853	alterations in the colour of the effused blood take place as a result of
 38854	changes in the blood pigment. In from twenty-four to forty-eight hours
 38855	the margins of the blue area become of a violet hue, and as time goes on
 38856	the discoloured area increases in size, and becomes successively green,
 38857	yellow, and lemon-coloured at its margins, the central part being the
 38858	last to change. The rate at which this play of colours proceeds is so
 38859	variable, and depends on so many circumstances, that no time-limits can
 38860	be laid down. During the disintegration of the effused blood the
 38861	adjacent lymph glands may become enlarged, and on dissection may be
 38862	found to be pigmented. Sometimes the blood persists as a collection of
 38863	fluid with a newly formed connective-tissue capsule, constituting a
 38864	_haematoma_ or _blood cyst_, more often met with in the scalp than in
 38865	other parts.
 38866	
 38867	The impairment of the blood supply of the skin may lead to the formation
 38868	of _blisters_, or to _necrosis_. Death of skin is more liable to occur
 38869	in bleeders, and when the slough separates the blood-clot is exposed and
 38870	the reparative changes go on extremely slowly. _Suppuration_ may occur
 38871	and lead to the formation of an abscess as a result of direct infection
 38872	from the skin or through the circulation.
 38873	
 38874	_Treatment._--If the patient is seen immediately after the accident,
 38875	elevation of the part, and firm pressure applied by means of a thick pad
 38876	of cotton wool and an elastic bandage, are useful in preventing effusion
 38877	of blood. Ice-bags and evaporating lotions are to be used with caution,
 38878	as they are liable to lower the vitality of the damaged tissues and lead
 38879	to necrosis of the skin.
 38880	
 38881	When extravasation has already taken place, massage is the most speedy
 38882	and efficacious means of dispersing the effused blood. The part should
 38883	be massaged several times a day, unless the presence of blebs or
 38884	abrasions of the skin prevents this being done. When this is the case,
 38885	the use of antiseptic dressings is called for to prevent infection and
 38886	to promote healing, after which massage is employed.
 38887	
 38888	When the tension caused by the extravasated blood threatens the vitality
 38889	of the skin, incisions may be made, if asepsis can be assured. The blood
 38890	from a haematoma may be withdrawn by an exploring needle, and the
 38891	puncture sealed with collodion. Infective complications must be looked
 38892	for and dealt with on general principles.
 38893	
 38894	
 38895	WOUNDS
 38896	
 38897	A wound is a solution in the continuity of the skin or mucous membrane
 38898	and of the underlying tissues, caused by violence.
 38899	
 38900	Three varieties of wounds are described: incised, punctured, and
 38901	contused and lacerated.
 38902	
 38903	#Incised Wounds.#--Typical examples of incised wounds are those made by
 38904	the surgeon in the course of an operation, wounds accidentally inflicted
 38905	by cutting instruments, and suicidal cut-throat wounds. It should be
 38906	borne in mind in connection with medico-legal inquiries, that wounds of
 38907	soft parts that closely overlie a bone, such as the skull, the tibia, or
 38908	the patella, although, inflicted by a blunt instrument, may have all the
 38909	appearances of incised wounds.
 38910	
 38911	_Clinical Features._--One of the characteristic features of an incised
 38912	wound is its tendency to gape. This is evident in long skin wounds, and
 38913	especially when the cut runs across the part, or when it extends deeply
 38914	enough to divide muscular fibres at right angles to their long axis. The
 38915	gaping of a wound, further, is more marked when the underlying tissues
 38916	are in a state of tension--as, for example, in inflamed parts. Incised
 38917	wounds in the palm of the hand, the sole of the foot, or the scalp,
 38918	however, have little tendency to gape, because of the close attachment
 38919	of the skin to the underlying fascia.
 38920	
 38921	Incised wounds, especially in inflamed tissues, tend to bleed profusely;
 38922	and when a vessel is only partly divided and is therefore unable to
 38923	contract, it continues to bleed longer than when completely cut across.
 38924	
 38925	The _special risks_ of incised wounds are: (1) division of large blood
 38926	vessels, leading to profuse haemorrhage; (2) division of nerve-trunks,
 38927	resulting in motor and sensory disturbances; and (3) division of tendons
 38928	or muscles, interfering with movement.
 38929	
 38930	_Treatment._--If haemorrhage is still going on, it must be arrested by
 38931	pressure, torsion, or ligature, as the accumulation of blood in a wound
 38932	interferes with union. If necessary, the wound should be purified by
 38933	washing with saline solution or eusol, and the surrounding skin painted
 38934	with iodine, after which the edges are approximated by sutures. The raw
 38935	surfaces must be brought into accurate apposition, care being taken that
 38936	no inversion of the cutaneous surface takes place. In extensive and deep
 38937	wounds, to ensure more complete closure and to prevent subsequent
 38938	stretching of the scar, it is advisable to unite the different
 38939	structures--muscles, fasciae, and subcutaneous tissue--by separate series
 38940	of _buried sutures_ of catgut or other absorbable material. For the
 38941	approximation of the skin edges, stitches of horse-hair, fishing-gut, or
 38942	fine silk are the most appropriate. These _stitches of coaptation_ may
 38943	be interrupted or continuous. In small superficial wounds on exposed
 38944	parts, stitch marks may be avoided by approximating the edges with
 38945	strips of gauze fixed in position by collodion, or by subcutaneous
 38946	sutures of fine catgut. Where the skin is loose, as, for example, in the
 38947	neck, on the limbs, or in the scrotum, the use of Michel's clips is
 38948	advantageous in so far as these bring the deep surfaces of the skin into
 38949	accurate apposition, are introduced with comparatively little pain, and
 38950	leave only a slight mark if removed within forty-eight hours.
 38951	
 38952	When there is any difficulty in bringing the edges of the wound into
 38953	apposition, a few interrupted _relaxation stitches_ may be introduced
 38954	wide of the margins, to take the strain off the coaptation stitches.
 38955	Stout silk, fishing-gut, or silver wire may be employed for this
 38956	purpose. When the tension is extreme, Lister's button suture may be
 38957	employed. The tension is relieved and death of skin prevented by scoring
 38958	it freely with a sharp knife. Relaxation stitches should be removed in
 38959	four or five days, and stitches of coaptation in from seven to ten days.
 38960	On the face and neck, wounds heal rapidly, and stitches may be removed
 38961	in two or three days, thus diminishing the marks they leave.
 38962	
 38963	_Drainage._--In wounds in which no cavity has been left, and in which
 38964	there is no reason to suspect infection, drainage is unnecessary. When,
 38965	however, the deeper parts of an extensive wound cannot be brought into
 38966	accurate apposition, and especially when there is any prospect of oozing
 38967	of blood or serum--as in amputation stumps or after excision of the
 38968	breast--drainage is indicated. It is a wise precaution also to insert
 38969	drainage tubes into wounds in fat patients when there is the slightest
 38970	reason to suspect the presence of infection. Glass or rubber tubes are
 38971	the best drains; but where it is desirable to leave little mark, a few
 38972	strands of horse-hair, or a small roll of rubber, form a satisfactory
 38973	substitute. Except when infection occurs, the drain is removed in from
 38974	one to four days and the opening closed with a Michel's clip or a
 38975	suture.
 38976	
 38977	#Punctured Wounds.#--Punctured wounds are produced by narrow, pointed
 38978	instruments, and the sharper and smoother the instrument the more does
 38979	the resulting injury resemble an incised wound; while from more rounded
 38980	and rougher instruments the edges of the wound are more or less contused
 38981	or lacerated. The depth of punctured wounds greatly exceeds their width,
 38982	and the damage to subcutaneous parts is usually greater than that to the
 38983	skin. When the instrument transfixes a part, the edges of the wound of
 38984	entrance may be inverted, and those of the exit wound everted. If the
 38985	instrument is a rough one, these conditions may be reversed by its
 38986	sudden withdrawal.
 38987	
 38988	Punctured wounds neither gape nor bleed much. Even when a large vessel
 38989	is implicated, the bleeding usually takes place into the tissues rather
 38990	than externally.
 38991	
 38992	The _risks_ incident to this class of wounds are: (1) the extreme
 38993	difficulty, especially when a dense fascia has been perforated, of
 38994	rendering them aseptic, on account of the uncertainty as to their depth,
 38995	and of the way in which the surface wound closes on the withdrawal of
 38996	the instrument; (2) different forms of aneurysm may result from the
 38997	puncture of a large vessel; (3) perforation of a joint, or of a serous
 38998	cavity, such as the abdomen, thorax, or skull, materially adds to the
 38999	danger.
 39000	
 39001	_Treatment._--The first indication is to purify the whole extent of the
 39002	wound, and to remove any foreign body or blood-clot that may be in it.
 39003	It is usually necessary to enlarge the wound, freely dividing injured
 39004	fasciae, paring away bruised tissues, and purifying the whole
 39005	wound-surface. Any blood vessel that is punctured should be cut across
 39006	and tied; and divided muscles, tendons, or nerves must be sutured. After
 39007	haemorrhage has been arrested, iodoform and bismuth paste is rubbed into
 39008	the raw surface, and the wound closed. If there is any reason to doubt
 39009	the asepticity of the wound, it is better treated by the open method,
 39010	and a Bier's bandage should be applied.
 39011	
 39012	#Contused and Lacerated Wounds.#--These may be considered together, as
 39013	they so occur in practice. They are produced by crushing, biting, or
 39014	tearing forms of violence--such as result from machinery accidents,
 39015	firearms, or the bites of animals. In addition to the irregular wound of
 39016	the integument, there is always more or less bruising of the parts
 39017	beneath and around, and the subcutaneous lesions are much wider than
 39018	appears on the surface.
 39019	
 39020	Wounds of this variety usually gape considerably, especially when there
 39021	is much laceration of the skin. It is not uncommon to have considerable
 39022	portions of skin, muscle, or tendon completely torn away.
 39023	
 39024	Haemorrhage is seldom a prominent feature, as the crushing or tearing of
 39025	the vessel wall leads to the obliteration of the lumen.
 39026	
 39027	The _special risks_ of these wounds are: (1) Sloughing of the bruised
 39028	tissues, especially when attempts to sterilise the wound have not been
 39029	successful. (2) Reactionary haemorrhage after the initial shock has
 39030	passed off. (3) Secondary haemorrhage as a result of infective processes
 39031	ensuing in the wound. (4) Loss of muscle or tendon, interfering with
 39032	motion. (5) Cicatricial contraction. (6) Gangrene, which may follow
 39033	occlusion of main vessels, or virulent infective processes. (7) It is
 39034	not uncommon to have particles of carbon embedded in the tissues after
 39035	lacerated wounds, leaving unsightly, pigmented scars. This is often seen
 39036	in coal-miners, and in those injured by firearms, and is to be prevented
 39037	by removing all gross dirt from the edges of the wound.
 39038	
 39039	_Treatment._--In severe wounds of this class implicating the
 39040	extremities, the most important question that arises is whether or not
 39041	the limb can be saved. In examining the limb, attention should first be
 39042	directed to the state of the main blood vessels, in order to determine
 39043	if the vascular supply of the part beyond the lesion is sufficient to
 39044	maintain its vitality. Amputation is usually called for if there is
 39045	complete absence of pulsation in the distal arteries and if the part
 39046	beyond is cold. If at the same time important nerve-trunks are
 39047	lacerated, so that the function of the limb would be seriously impaired,
 39048	it is not worth running the risk of attempting to save it. If, in
 39049	addition, there is extensive destruction of large muscular masses or of
 39050	important tendons, or comminution of the bones, amputation is usually
 39051	imperative. Stripping of large areas of skin is not in itself a reason
 39052	for removing a limb, as much can be done by skin grafting, but when it
 39053	is associated with other lesions it favours amputation. In considering
 39054	these points, it must be borne in mind that the damage to the deeper
 39055	tissues is always more extensive than appears on the surface, and that
 39056	in many cases it is only possible to estimate the real extent of the
 39057	injury by administering an anaesthetic and exploring the wound. In
 39058	doubtful cases the possibility of rendering the parts aseptic will often
 39059	decide the question for or against amputation. If thorough purification
 39060	is accomplished, the success which attends conservative measures is
 39061	often remarkable. It is permissible to run an amount of risk to save an
 39062	upper extremity which would be unjustifiable in the case of a lower
 39063	limb. The age and occupation of the patient must also be taken into
 39064	account.
 39065	
 39066	It having been decided to try and save the limb, the question is only
 39067	settled for the moment; it may have to be reconsidered from day to day,
 39068	or even from hour to hour, according to the progress of the case.
 39069	
 39070	When it is decided to make the attempt to save the limb, the wound must
 39071	be thoroughly purified. All bruised tissue in which gross dirt has
 39072	become engrained should be cut away with knife or scissors. The raw
 39073	surface is then cleansed with eusol, washed with sterilised salt
 39074	solution followed by methylated spirit, and rubbed all over with "bipp"
 39075	paste. If the purification is considered satisfactory the wound may be
 39076	closed, otherwise it is left open, freely drained or packed with gauze,
 39077	and the limb is immobilised by suitable splints.
 39078	
 39079	
 39080	WOUNDS BY FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES
 39081	
 39082	It is not necessary here to do more than indicate the general characters
 39083	of wounds produced by modern weapons. For further details the reader is
 39084	referred to works on military surgery. Experience has shown that the
 39085	nature and severity of the injuries sustained in warfare vary widely in
 39086	
 39087	different campaigns, and even in different fields of the same campaign.
 39088	Slight variations in the size, shape, and weight of rifle bullets, for
 39089	example, may profoundly modify the lesions they produce: witness the
 39090	destructive effect of the pointed bullet compared with that of the
 39091	conical form previously used. The conditions under which the fighting is
 39092	carried on also influence the wounds. Those sustained in the open,
 39093	long-range fighting of the South African campaign of 1899-1902 were very
 39094	different from those met with in the entrenched warfare in France in
 39095	1914-1918. It has been found also that the infective complications are
 39096	greatly influenced by the terrain in which the fighting takes place. In
 39097	the dry, sandy, uncultivated veldt of South Africa, bullet wounds seldom
 39098	became infected, while those sustained in the highly manured fields of
 39099	Belgium were almost invariably contaminated with putrefactive organisms,
 39100	and gaseous gangrene and tetanus were common complications. It has been
 39101	found also that wounds inflicted in naval engagements present different
 39102	characters from those sustained on land. Many other factors, such as the
 39103	physical and mental condition of the men, the facilities for affording
 39104	first aid, and the transport arrangements, also play a part in
 39105	determining the nature and condition of the wounds that have to be dealt
 39106	with by military surgeons.
 39107	
 39108	Whatever the nature of the weapon concerned, the wound is of the
 39109	_punctured, contused, and lacerated_ variety. Its severity depends on
 39110	the size, shape, and velocity of the missile, the range at which the
 39111	weapon is discharged, and the part of the body struck.
 39112	
 39113	Shock is a prominent feature, but its degree, as well as the time of its
 39114	onset, varies with the extent and seat of the injury, and with the
 39115	mental state of the patient when wounded. We have observed pronounced
 39116	shock in children after being shot even when no serious injury was
 39117	sustained. At the moment of injury the patient experiences a sensation
 39118	which is variously described as being like the lash of a whip, a blow
 39119	with a stick, or an electric shock. There is not much pain at first, but
 39120	later it may become severe, and is usually associated with intense
 39121	thirst, especially when much blood has been lost.
 39122	
 39123	In all forms of wounds sustained in warfare, septic infection
 39124	constitutes the main risk, particularly that resulting from
 39125	streptococci. The presence of anaerobic organisms introduces the
 39126	additional danger of gaseous forms of gangrene.
 39127	
 39128	The earlier the wound is disinfected the greater is the possibility of
 39129	diminishing this risk. If cleansing is carried out within the first six
 39130	hours the chance of eliminating sepsis is good; with every succeeding
 39131	six hours it diminishes, until after twenty-four hours it is seldom
 39132	possible to do more than mitigate sepsis. (J. T. Morrison.)
 39133	
 39134	The presence of a metallic foreign body having been determined and its
 39135	position localised by means of the X-rays, all devitalised and
 39136	contaminated tissue is excised, the foreign material, _e.g._, a missile,
 39137	fragments of clothing, gravel and blood-clot, removed, the wound
 39138	purified with antiseptics and closed or drained according to
 39139	circumstances.
 39140	
 39141	#Pistol-shot Wounds.#--Wounds inflicted by pistols, revolvers, and small
 39142	air-guns are of frequent occurrence in civil practice, the weapon being
 39143	discharged usually by accident, but frequently with suicidal, and
 39144	sometimes with homicidal intent.
 39145	
 39146	With all calibres and at all ranges, except actual contact, the wound of
 39147	entrance is smaller than the bullet. If the weapon is discharged within
 39148	a foot of the body, the skin surrounding the wound is usually stained
 39149	with powder and burned, and the hair singed. At ranges varying from six
 39150	inches to thirty feet, grains of powder may be found embedded in the
 39151	skin or lying loose on the surface, the greater the range the wider
 39152	being the area of spread. When black powder is used, the embedded grains
 39153	usually leave a permanent bluish-black tattooing of the skin. When the
 39154	weapon is placed in contact with the skin, the subcutaneous tissues are
 39155	lacerated over an area of two or three inches around the opening made by
 39156	the bullet and smoke and powder-staining and scorching are more marked
 39157	than at longer ranges.
 39158	
 39159	When the bullet perforates, the exit wound is usually larger and more
 39160	extensively lacerated than the wound of entrance. Its margins are as a
 39161	rule everted, and it shows no marks of flame, smoke, or powder. These
 39162	features are common to all perforations caused by bullets.
 39163	
 39164	Pistol wounds only produce dangerous effects when fired at close range,
 39165	and when the cavities of the skull, the thorax, or the abdomen are
 39166	implicated. In the abdomen a lethal injury may readily be caused even by
 39167	pistols of the "toy" order. These injuries will be described with
 39168	regional surgery.
 39169	
 39170	Pistol-shot wounds of _joints_ and _soft parts_ are seldom of serious
 39171	import apart from the risk of haemorrhage and of infection.
 39172	
 39173	_Treatment._--The treatment of wounds of the soft parts consists in
 39174	purifying the wounds of entrance and exit and the surrounding skin, and
 39175	in providing for drainage if this is indicated.
 39176	
 39177	There being no urgency for the removal of the bullet, time should be
 39178	taken to have it localised by the X-rays, preferably by stereoscopic
 39179	plates. In some cases it is not necessary to remove the bullet.
 39180	
 39181	#Wounds by Sporting Guns.#--In the common sporting or scatter gun, with
 39182	which accidents so commonly occur during the shooting season, the charge
 39183	of small shot or pellets leave the muzzle of the gun as a solid mass
 39184	which makes a single ragged wound having much the appearance of that
 39185	caused by a single bullet. At a distance of from four to five feet from
 39186	the muzzle the pellets begin to disperse so that there are separate
 39187	punctures around the main central wound. As the range increases, these
 39188	outlying punctures make a wider and wider pattern, until at a distance
 39189	of from eighteen to twenty feet from the muzzle, the scattering is
 39190	complete, there is no longer any central wound, and each individual
 39191	pellet makes its own puncture. From these elementary data, it is usually
 39192	possible, from the features of the wound, to arrive at an approximately
 39193	accurate conclusion regarding the range at which the gun was discharged,
 39194	and this may have an important bearing on the question of accident,
 39195	suicide, or murder.
 39196	
 39197	As regards the effects on the tissues at close range, that is, within a
 39198	few feet, there is widespread laceration and disruption; if a bone is
 39199	struck it is shattered, and portions of bone may be displaced or even
 39200	driven out through the exit wound.
 39201	
 39202	When the charge impinges over one of the large cavities of the body, the
 39203	shot may scatter widely through the contained viscera, and there is
 39204	often no exit wound. In the thorax, for example, if a rib is struck, the
 39205	charge and possibly fragments of bone, will penetrate the pleura, and be
 39206	dispersed throughout the lung; in the head, the skull may be shattered
 39207	and the brain torn up; and in the abdomen, the hollow viscera may be
 39208	perforated in many places and the solid organs lacerated.
 39209	
 39210	On covered parts the clothing, by deflecting the shot, influences the
 39211	size and shape of the wound; the entrance wound is increased in size and
 39212	more ragged, and portions of the clothes may be driven into the tissues.
 39213	
 39214	[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Radiogram showing Pellets embedded in Arm.
 39215	
 39216	(Mr. J. W. Dowden's case.)]
 39217	
 39218	A charge of small shot is much more destructive to blood vessels,
 39219	tendons, and ligaments than a single bullet, which in many cases pushes
 39220	such structures aside without dividing them. In the abdomen and chest,
 39221	also, the damage done by a full charge of shot is much more extensive
 39222	than that inflicted by a single bullet, the deflection of the pellets
 39223	leading to a greater number of perforations of the intestine and more
 39224	widespread laceration of solid viscera.
 39225	
 39226	When the charge impinges on one of the extremities at close range, we
 39227	often have the opportunity of observing that the exit wound is larger,
 39228	more ragged than that of entrance, and that its edges are everted; the
 39229	extensive tearing and bruising of all the tissues, including the bones,
 39230	and the marked tendency to early and progressive septic infection,
 39231	render amputation compulsory in the majority of such cases.
 39232	
 39233	At a range of from twenty to thirty feet, although the scatter is
 39234	complete, the pellets are still close together, so that if they
 39235	encounter the shaft of a long bone, even the femur, they fracture the
 39236	bone across, often along with some longitudinal splintering.
 39237	
 39238	Individual pellets striking the shafts of long bones become flattened or
 39239	distorted, and when cancellated bone is struck they become embedded in
 39240	it (Fig. 62).
 39241	
 39242	The skin, when it is closely peppered with shot, is liable to lose its
 39243	vitality, and with the addition of a little sepsis, readily necroses and
 39244	comes away as a slough.
 39245	
 39246	When the shot have diverged so as to strike singly, they seldom do much
 39247	harm, but fatal damage may be done to the brain or to the aorta, or the
 39248	eye may be seriously injured by a single pellet.
 39249	
 39250	Small shot fired at longer ranges--over about a hundred and fifty
 39251	feet--usually go through the skin, but seldom pierce the fascia, and lie
 39252	embedded in the subcutaneous tissue, from which they can readily be
 39253	extracted.
 39254	
 39255	The wad of the cartridge behaves erratically: so long as it remains flat
 39256	it goes off with the rest of the charge, and is often buried in the
 39257	wound; but if it curls up or turns on its side, it is usually deflected
 39258	and flies clear of the shot. It may make a separate wound.
 39259	
 39260	Wounds from sporting guns are to be _treated_ on the usual lines, the
 39261	early efforts being directed to the alleviation of shock and the
 39262	prevention of septic infection. There is rarely any urgency in the
 39263	removal of pellets from the tissues.
 39264	
 39265	#Wounds by Rifle Bullets.#--The vast majority of wounds inflicted by
 39266	rifle bullets are met with in the field during active warfare, and fall
 39267	to be treated by military surgeons. They occasionally occur
 39268	accidentally, however, during range practice for example, and may then
 39269	come under the notice of the civil surgeon.
 39270	
 39271	It is only necessary here to consider the effects of modern small-bore
 39272	rifle or machine-gun bullets.
 39273	
 39274	The trajectory is practically flat up to 675 yards. In destructive
 39275	effect there is not much difference between the various high velocity
 39276	bullets used in different armies; they will kill up to a distance of two
 39277	miles. The hard covering is employed to enable the bullet to take the
 39278	grooves in the rifle, and to prevent it stripping as it passes through
 39279	the barrel. It also increases the penetrating power of the missile, but
 39280	diminishes its "stopping" power, unless a vital part or a long bone is
 39281	struck. By removing the covering from the point of the bullet, as is
 39282	done in the Dum-Dum bullet, or by splitting the end, the bullet is made
 39283	to expand or "mushroom" when it strikes the body, and its stopping power
 39284	is thereby greatly increased, the resulting wound being much more
 39285	severe. These "soft-nosed" expanding bullets are to be distinguished
 39286	from "explosive" bullets which contain substances which detonate on
 39287	impact. High velocity bullets are unlikely to lodge in the body unless
 39288	spent, or pulled up by a sandbag, or metal buckle on a belt, or a book
 39289	in the pocket, or the core and the case separating--"stripping" of the
 39290	bullet. Spent shot may merely cause bruising of the surface, or they may
 39291	pass through the skin and lodge in the subcutaneous tissue, or may even
 39292	damage some deeper structure such as a nerve trunk.
 39293	
 39294	A blank cartridge fired at close range may cause a severe wound, and, if
 39295	charged with black powder, may leave a permanent bluish-black
 39296	pigmentation of the skin.
 39297	
 39298	The lesions of individual tissues--bones, nerves, blood vessels--are
 39299	considered with these.
 39300	
 39301	#Treatment of Gunshot Wounds under War Conditions.#--It is only
 39302	necessary to indicate briefly the method of dealing with gunshot wounds
 39303	in warfare as practised in the European War.
 39304	
 39305	1. _On the Field._--Haemorrhage is arrested in the limbs by an improvised
 39306	tourniquet; in the head by a pad and bandage; in the thorax or abdomen
 39307	by packing if necessary, but this should be avoided if possible, as it
 39308	favours septic infection. If a limb is all but detached it should be
 39309	completely severed. A full dose of morphin is given hypodermically. The
 39310	ampoule of iodine carried by the wounded man is broken, and its contents
 39311	are poured over and around the wound, after which the field dressing is
 39312	applied. In extensive wounds, the "shell-dressing" carried by the
 39313	stretcher bearers is preferred. All bandages are applied loosely to
 39314	allow for subsequent swelling. The fragments of fractured bones are
 39315	immobilised by some form of emergency splint.
 39316	
 39317	2. _At the Advanced Dressing Station_, after the patient has had a
 39318	liberal allowance of warm fluid nourishment, such as soup or tea, a full
 39319	dose of anti-tetanic serum is injected. The tourniquet is removed and
 39320	the wound inspected. Urgent amputations are performed. Moribund patients
 39321	are detained lest they die _en route_.
 39322	
 39323	3. _In the Field Ambulance or Casualty Clearing Station_ further
 39324	measures are employed for the relief of shock, and urgent operations are
 39325	performed, such as amputation for gangrene, tracheotomy for dyspnoea, or
 39326	laparotomy for perforated or lacerated intestine. In the majority of
 39327	cases the main object is to guard against infection; the skin is
 39328	disinfected over a wide area and surrounded with towels; damaged tissue,
 39329	especially muscle, is removed with the knife or scissors, and foreign
 39330	bodies are extracted. Torn blood vessels, and, if possible, nerves and
 39331	tendons are repaired. The wound is then partly closed, provision being
 39332	made for free drainage, or some special method of irrigation, such as
 39333	that of Carrel, is adopted. Sometimes the wound is treated with bismuth,
 39334	iodoform, and paraffin paste (B.I.P.P.) and sutured.
 39335	
 39336	4. _In the Base Hospital or Hospital Ship_ various measures may be
 39337	called for according to the progress of the wound and the condition of
 39338	the patient.
 39339	
 39340	#Shell Wounds and Wounds produced by Explosions.#--It is convenient to
 39341	consider together the effects of the bursting of shells fired from heavy
 39342	ordnance and those resulting in the course of blasting operations from
 39343	the discharge of dynamite or other explosives, or from the bursting of
 39344	steam boilers or pipes, the breaking of machinery, and similar accidents
 39345	met with in civil practice.
 39346	
 39347	Wounds inflicted by shell fragments and shrapnel bullets tend to be
 39348	extensive in area, and show great contusion, laceration, and destruction
 39349	of the tissues. The missiles frequently lodge and carry portions of the
 39350	clothing and, it may be, articles from the man's pocket, with them.
 39351	Shell wounds are attended with a considerable degree of shock. On
 39352	account of the wide area of contusion which surrounds the actual wound
 39353	produced by shell fragments, amputation, when called for, should be
 39354	performed some distance above the torn tissues, as there is considerable
 39355	risk of sloughing of the flaps.
 39356	
 39357	Wounds produced by dynamite explosions and the bursting of boilers have
 39358	the same general characters as shell wounds. Fragments of stone, coal,
 39359	or metal may lodge in the tissues, and favour the occurrence of
 39360	infective complications.
 39361	
 39362	All such injuries are to be treated on the general principles governing
 39363	contused and lacerated wounds.
 39364	
 39365	
 39366	EMBEDDED FOREIGN BODIES
 39367	
 39368	In the course of many operations foreign substances are introduced into
 39369	the tissues and intentionally left there, for example, suture and
 39370	ligature materials, steel or aluminium plates, silver wire or ivory pegs
 39371	used to secure the fixation of bones, or solid paraffin employed to
 39372	correct deformities. Other substances, such as gauze, drainage tubes,
 39373	or metal instruments, may be unintentionally left in a wound.
 39374	
 39375	Foreign bodies may also lodge in accidentally inflicted wounds, for
 39376	example, bullets, needles, splinters of wood, or fragments of clothing.
 39377	The needles of hypodermic syringes sometimes break and a portion remains
 39378	embedded in the tissues. As a result of explosions, particles of carbon,
 39379	in the form of coal-dust or gunpowder, or portions of shale, may lodge
 39380	in a wound.
 39381	
 39382	The embedded foreign body at first acts as an irritant, and induces a
 39383	reaction in the tissues in which it lodges, in the form of hyperaemia,
 39384	local leucocytosis, proliferation of fibroblasts, and the formation of
 39385	granulation tissue. The subsequent changes depend upon whether or not
 39386	the wound is infected with pyogenic bacteria. If it is so infected,
 39387	suppuration ensues, a sinus forms, and persists until the foreign body
 39388	is either cast out or removed.
 39389	
 39390	If the wound is aseptic, the fate of the foreign body varies with its
 39391	character. A substance that is absorbable, such as catgut or fine silk,
 39392	is surrounded and permeated by the phagocytes, which soften and
 39393	disintegrate it, the debris being gradually absorbed in much the same
 39394	manner as a fibrinous exudate. Minute bodies that are not capable of
 39395	being absorbed, such as particles of carbon, or of pigment used in
 39396	tattooing, are taken up by the phagocytes, and in course of time
 39397	removed. Larger bodies, such as needles or bullets, which are not
 39398	capable of being destroyed by the phagocytes, become encapsulated. In
 39399	the granulation tissue by which they are surrounded large multinuclear
 39400	giant-cells appear ("_foreign-body giant-cells_") and attach themselves
 39401	to the foreign body, the fibroblasts proliferate and a capsule of scar
 39402	tissue is eventually formed around the body. The tissues of the capsule
 39403	may show evidence of iron pigmentation. Sometimes fluid accumulates
 39404	around a foreign body within its capsule, constituting a cyst.
 39405	
 39406	Substances like paraffin, strands of silk used to bridge a gap in a
 39407	tendon, or portions of calcined bone, instead of being encapsulated, are
 39408	gradually permeated and eventually replaced by new connective tissue.
 39409	
 39410	Embedded bodies may remain in the tissues for an indefinite period
 39411	without giving rise to inconvenience. At any time, however, they may
 39412	cause trouble, either as a result of infective complications, or by
 39413	inducing the formation of a mass of inflammatory tissue around them,
 39414	which may simulate a gumma, a tuberculous focus, or a sarcoma. This
 39415	latter condition may give rise to difficulties in diagnosis,
 39416	particularly if there is no history forthcoming of the entrance of the
 39417	foreign body. The ignorance of patients regarding the possible lodgment
 39418	in the tissues of a foreign body--even of considerable size--is
 39419	remarkable. In such cases the X-rays will reveal the presence of the
 39420	foreign body if it is sufficiently opaque to cast a shadow. The heavy,
 39421	lead-containing varieties of glass throw very definite shadows little
 39422	inferior in sharpness and definition to those of metal; almost all the
 39423	ordinary forms of commercial glass also may be shown up by the X-rays.
 39424	
 39425	Foreign bodies encapsulated in the peritoneal cavity are specially
 39426	dangerous, as the proximity of the intestine furnishes a constant
 39427	possibility of infection.
 39428	
 39429	The question of removal of the foreign body must be decided according to
 39430	the conditions present in individual cases; in searching for a foreign
 39431	body in the tissues, unless it has been accurately located, a general
 39432	anaesthetic is to be preferred.
 39433	
 39434	
 39435	BURNS AND SCALDS
 39436	
 39437	The distinction between a burn which results from the action of dry heat
 39438	on the tissues of the body and a scald which results from the action of
 39439	moist heat, has no clinical significance.
 39440	
 39441	In young and debilitated subjects hot poultices may produce injuries of
 39442	the nature of burns. In old people with enfeebled circulation mere
 39443	exposure to a strong fire may cause severe degrees of burning, the
 39444	clothes covering the part being uninjured. This may also occur about the
 39445	feet, legs, or knees of persons while intoxicated who have fallen asleep
 39446	before the fire.
 39447	
 39448	The damage done to the tissues by strong caustics, such as fuming nitric
 39449	acid, sulphuric acid, caustic potash, nitrate of silver, or arsenical
 39450	paste, presents pathological and clinical features almost identical with
 39451	those resulting from heat. Electricity and the Rontgen rays also produce
 39452	lesions of the nature of burns.
 39453	
 39454	_Pathology of Burns._--Much discussion has taken place regarding the
 39455	explanation of the rapidly fatal issue in extensive superficial burns.
 39456	On post-mortem examination the lesions found in these cases are: (1)
 39457	general hyperaemia of all the organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and
 39458	cerebro-spinal cavities; (2) marked leucocytosis, with destruction of
 39459	red corpuscles, setting free haemoglobin which lodges in the epithelial
 39460	cells of the tubules of the kidneys; (3) minute thrombi and
 39461	extravasations throughout the tissues of the body; (4) degeneration of
 39462	the ganglion cells of the solar plexus; (5) oedema and degeneration of
 39463	the lymphoid tissue throughout the body; (6) cloudy swelling of the
 39464	liver and kidneys, and softening and enlargement of the spleen. Bardeen
 39465	suggests that these morbid phenomena correspond so closely to those met
 39466	with where the presence of a toxin is known to produce them, that in all
 39467	probability death is similarly due to the action of some poison produced
 39468	by the action of heat on the skin and on the proteins of the blood.
 39469	
 39470	#Clinical Features--Local Phenomena.#--The most generally accepted
 39471	classification of burns is that of Dupuytren, which is based upon the
 39472	depth of the lesion. Six degrees are thus, recognised: (1) hyperaemia or
 39473	erythema; (2) vesication; (3) partial destruction of the true skin; (4)
 39474	total destruction of the true skin; (5) charring of muscles; (6)
 39475	charring of bones.
 39476	
 39477	It must be observed, however, that burns met with at the bedside always
 39478	illustrate more than one of these degrees, the deeper forms always being
 39479	associated with those less deep, and the clinical picture is made up of
 39480	the combined characters of all. A burn is classified in terms of its
 39481	most severe portion. It is also to be remarked that the extent and
 39482	severity of a burn usually prove to be greater than at first sight
 39483	appears.
 39484	
 39485	_Burns of the first degree_ are associated with erythema of the skin,
 39486	due to hyperaemia of its blood vessels, and result from scorching by
 39487	flame, from contact with solids or fluids below 212 o F., or from
 39488	exposure to the sun's rays. They are characterised clinically by acute
 39489	pain, redness, transitory swelling from oedema, and subsequent
 39490	desquamation of the surface layers of the epidermis. A special form of
 39491	pigmentation of the skin is seen on the front of the legs of women from
 39492	exposure to the heat of the fire.
 39493	
 39494	_Burns of Second Degree--Vesication of the Skin._--These are
 39495	characterised by the occurrence of vesicles or blisters which are
 39496	scattered over the hyperaemic area, and contain a clear yellowish or
 39497	brownish fluid. On removing the raised epidermis, the congested and
 39498	highly sensitive papillae of the skin are exposed. Unna has found that
 39499	pyogenic bacteria are invariably present in these blisters. Burns of the
 39500	second degree leave no scar but frequently a persistent discoloration.
 39501	In rare instances the burned area becomes the seat of a peculiar
 39502	overgrowth of fibrous tissue of the nature of keloid (p 401).
 39503	
 39504	_Burns of Third Degree--Partial Destruction of the Skin._--The epidermis
 39505	and papillae are destroyed in patches, leaving hard, dry, and insensitive
 39506	sloughs of a yellow or black colour. The pain in these burns is
 39507	intense, but passes off during the first or second day, to return again,
 39508	however, when, about the end of a week, the sloughs separate and expose
 39509	the nerve filaments of the underlying skin. Granulations spring up to
 39510	fill the gap, and are rapidly covered by epithelium, derived partly from
 39511	the margins and partly from the remains of skin glands which have not
 39512	been completely destroyed. These latter appear on the surface of the
 39513	granulations as small bluish islets which gradually increase in size,
 39514	become of a greyish-white colour, and ultimately blend with one another
 39515	and with the edges. The resulting cicatrix may be slightly depressed,
 39516	but otherwise exhibits little tendency to contract and cause deformity.
 39517	
 39518	_Burns of Fourth Degree--Total Destruction of the Skin._--These follow
 39519	the more prolonged action of any form of intense heat. Large, black, dry
 39520	eschars are formed, surrounded by a zone of intense congestion. Pain is
 39521	less severe, and is referred to the parts that have been burned to a
 39522	less degree. Infection is liable to occur and to lead to wide
 39523	destruction of the surrounding skin. The amount of granulation tissue
 39524	necessary to fill the gap is therefore great; and as the epithelial
 39525	covering can only be derived from the margins--the skin glands being
 39526	completely destroyed--the healing process is slow. The resulting scars
 39527	are irregular, deep and puckered, and show a great tendency to contract.
 39528	Keloid frequently develops in such cicatrices. When situated in the
 39529	region of the face, neck, or flexures of joints, much deformity and
 39530	impairment of function may result (Fig. 63).
 39531	
 39532	[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Cicatricial Contraction following Severe Burn.]
 39533	
 39534	In _burns of the fifth degree_ the lesion extends through the
 39535	subcutaneous tissue and involves the muscles; while in those of the
 39536	_sixth degree_ it passes still more deeply and implicates the bones.
 39537	These burns are comparatively limited in area, as they are usually
 39538	produced by prolonged contact with hot metal or caustics. Burns of the
 39539	fifth and sixth degrees are met with in epileptics or intoxicated
 39540	persons who fall into the fire. Large blood vessels, nerve-trunks,
 39541	joints, or serous cavities may be implicated.
 39542	
 39543	#General Phenomena.#--It is customary to divide the clinical history of
 39544	a severe burn into three periods; but it is to be observed that the
 39545	features characteristic of the periods have been greatly modified since
 39546	burns have been treated on the same lines as other wounds.
 39547	
 39548	_The first period_ lasts for from thirty-six to forty-eight hours,
 39549	during which time the patient remains in a more or less profound state
 39550	of _shock_, and there is a remarkable absence of pain. When shock is
 39551	absent or little marked, however, the amount of suffering may be great.
 39552	When the injury proves fatal during this period, death is due to shock,
 39553	probably aggravated by the absorption of poisonous substances produced
 39554	in the burned tissues. In fatal cases there is often evidence of
 39555	cerebral congestion and oedema.
 39556	
 39557	The _second period_ begins when the shock passes off, and lasts till the
 39558	sloughs separate. The outstanding feature of this period is _toxaemia_,
 39559	manifested by fever, the temperature rising to 102 o, 103 o, or 104 o F.,
 39560	and congestive or inflammatory conditions of internal organs, giving
 39561	rise to such clinical complications as bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, or
 39562	pleurisy--especially in burns of the thorax; or meningitis and
 39563	cerebritis, when the neck or head is the seat of the burn. Intestinal
 39564	catarrh associated with diarrhoea is not uncommon; and ulceration of the
 39565	duodenum leading to perforation has been met with in a few cases. These
 39566	phenomena are much more prominent when bacterial infection has taken
 39567	place, and it seems probable that they are to be attributed chiefly to
 39568	the infection, as they have become less frequent and less severe since
 39569	burns have been treated like other breaches of the surface. Albuminuria
 39570	is a fairly constant symptom in severe burns, and is associated with
 39571	congestion of the kidneys. In burns implicating the face, neck, mouth,
 39572	or pharynx, oedema of the glottis is a dangerous complication, entailing
 39573	as it does the risk of suffocation.
 39574	
 39575	The _third period_ begins when the sloughs separate, usually between
 39576	the seventh and fourteenth days, and lasts till the wound heals, its
 39577	duration depending upon the size, depth, and asepticity of the raw area.
 39578	The chief causes of death during this period are toxin absorption in any
 39579	of its forms; waxy disease of the liver, kidneys, or intestine; less
 39580	commonly erysipelas, tetanus, or other diseases due to infection by
 39581	specific organisms. We have seen nothing to substantiate the belief that
 39582	duodenal ulcers are liable to perforate during the third period.
 39583	
 39584	The _prognosis_ in burns depends on (1) the superficial extent, and, to
 39585	a much less degree, the depth of the injury. When more than one-third of
 39586	the entire surface of the body is involved, even in a mild degree, the
 39587	prognosis is grave. (2) The situation of the burn is important. Burns
 39588	over the serous cavities--abdomen, thorax, or skull--are, other things
 39589	being equal, much more dangerous than burns of the limbs. The risk of
 39590	oedema of the glottis in burns about the neck and mouth has already been
 39591	referred to. (3) Children are more liable to succumb to shock during the
 39592	early period, but withstand prolonged suppuration better than adults.
 39593	(4) When the patient survives the shock, the presence or absence of
 39594	infection is the all-important factor in prognosis.
 39595	
 39596	#Treatment.#--The _general treatment_ consists in combating the shock.
 39597	When pain is severe, morphin must be injected.
 39598	
 39599	_Local Treatment._--The local treatment must be carried out on
 39600	antiseptic lines, a general anaesthetic being administered, if necessary,
 39601	to enable the purification to be carried out thoroughly. After carefully
 39602	removing the clothing, the whole of the burned area is gently, but
 39603	thoroughly, cleansed with peroxide of hydrogen or warm boracic lotion,
 39604	followed by sterilised saline solution. As pyogenic bacteria are
 39605	invariably found in the blisters of burns, these must be opened and the
 39606	raised epithelium removed.
 39607	
 39608	The dressings subsequently applied should meet the following
 39609	indications: the relief of pain; the prevention of sepsis; and the
 39610	promotion of cicatrisation.
 39611	
 39612	An application which satisfactorily fulfils these requirements is
 39613	_picric acid_. Pads of lint or gauze are lightly wrung out of a solution
 39614	made up of picric acid, 1 1/2 drams; absolute alcohol, 3 ounces;
 39615	distilled water, 40 ounces, and applied over the whole of the reddened
 39616	area. These are covered with antiseptic wool, _without_ any waterproof
 39617	covering, and retained in position by a many-tailed bandage. The
 39618	dressing should be changed once or twice a week, under the guidance of
 39619	the temperature chart, any portion of the original dressing which
 39620	remains perfectly dry being left undisturbed. The value of a general
 39621	anaesthetic in dressing extensive burns, especially in children, can
 39622	scarcely be overestimated.
 39623	
 39624	Picric acid yields its best results in superficial burns, and it is
 39625	useful as _a primary dressing_ in all. As soon as the sloughs separate
 39626	and a granulating surface forms, the ordinary treatment for a healing
 39627	sore is instituted. Any slough under which pus has collected should be
 39628	cut away with scissors to permit of free drainage.
 39629	
 39630	An occlusive dressing of melted _paraffin_ has also been employed. A
 39631	useful preparation consists of: Paraffin molle 25 per cent., paraffin
 39632	durum 67 per cent., olive oil 5 per cent., oil of eucalyptus 2 per
 39633	cent., and beta-naphthol 1/4 per cent. It has a melting point of 48 o C.
 39634	It is also known as _Ambrine_ and _Burnol_. After the burned area has
 39635	been cleansed and thoroughly dried, it is sponged or painted with the
 39636	melted paraffin, and before solidification takes place a layer of
 39637	sterilised gauze is applied and covered with a second coating of
 39638	paraffin. Further coats of paraffin are applied every other day to
 39639	prevent the gauze sticking to the skin.
 39640	
 39641	An alternative method of treating extensive burns is by immersing the
 39642	part, or even the whole body when the trunk is affected, in a bath of
 39643	boracic lotion kept at the body temperature, the lotion being frequently
 39644	renewed.
 39645	
 39646	If a burn is already infected when first seen, it is to be treated on
 39647	the same principles as govern the treatment of other infected wounds.
 39648	
 39649	All moist or greasy applications, such as Carron oil, carbolic oil and
 39650	ointments, and all substances like collodion and dry powders, which
 39651	retain discharges, entirely fail to meet the indications for the
 39652	rational treatment of burns, and should be abandoned.
 39653	
 39654	Skin-grafting is of great value in hastening healing after extensive
 39655	burns, and in preventing cicatricial contraction. The _deformities_
 39656	which are so liable to develop from contraction of the cicatrices are
 39657	treated on general principles. In the region of the face, neck, and
 39658	flexures of joints (Fig. 63), where they are most marked, the contracted
 39659	bands may be divided and the parts stretched, the raw surface left being
 39660	covered by Thiersch grafts or by flaps of skin raised from adjacent
 39661	surfaces or from other parts of the body (Fig. 1).
 39662	
 39663	
 39664	INJURIES PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY
 39665	
 39666	#Injuries produced by Exposure to X-Rays and Radium.#--In the routine
 39667	treatment of disease by radiations, injury is sometimes done to the
 39668	tissues, even when the greatest care is exercised as to dosage and
 39669	frequency of application. Robert Knox describes the following
 39670	ill-effects.
 39671	
 39672	_Acute dermatitis_ varying in degree from a slight erythema to deep
 39673	ulceration or even necrosis of skin. When ulcers form they are extremely
 39674	painful and slow to heal. When hair-bearing areas are affected,
 39675	epilation may occur without destroying the hair follicles and the hairs
 39676	are reproduced, but if the reaction is excessive permanent alopecia may
 39677	result.
 39678	
 39679	_Chronic dermatitis_, which results from persistence of the acute form,
 39680	is most intractable and may assume malignant characters. X-ray warts are
 39681	a late manifestation of chronic dermatitis and may become malignant.
 39682	
 39683	Among the _late manifestations_ are neuritis, telangiectasis, and a
 39684	painful and intractable form of ulceration, any of which may come on
 39685	months or even years after the cessation of exposure. _Sterility_ may be
 39686	induced in X-ray workers who are imperfectly protected from the effects
 39687	of the rays.
 39688	
 39689	#Electrical burns# usually occur in those who are engaged in industrial
 39690	undertakings where powerful electrical currents are employed.
 39691	
 39692	The lesions--which vary from a slight superficial scorching to complete
 39693	charring of parts--are most evident at the points of entrance and exit
 39694	of the current, the intervening tissues apparently escaping injury.
 39695	
 39696	The more superficial degrees of electrical burns differ from those
 39697	produced by heat in being almost painless, and in healing very slowly,
 39698	although as a rule they remain dry and aseptic.
 39699	
 39700	The more severe forms are attended with a considerable degree of shock,
 39701	which is not only more profound, but also lasts much longer than the
 39702	shock in an ordinary burn of corresponding severity. The parts at the
 39703	point of entrance of the current are charred to a greater or lesser
 39704	depth. The eschar is at first dry and crisp, and is surrounded by a zone
 39705	of pallor. For the first thirty-six to forty-eight hours there is
 39706	comparatively little suffering, but at the end of that time the parts
 39707	become exceedingly painful. In a majority of cases, in spite of careful
 39708	purification, a slow form of moist gangrene sets in, and the slough
 39709	spreads both in area and in depth, until the muscles and often the
 39710	large blood vessels and nerves are exposed. A line of demarcation
 39711	eventually forms, but the sloughs are exceedingly slow to separate,
 39712	taking from three to five times as long as in an ordinary burn, and
 39713	during the process of separation there is considerable risk of secondary
 39714	haemorrhage from erosion of large vessels.
 39715	
 39716	_Treatment._--Electrical burns are treated on the same lines as ordinary
 39717	burns, by thorough purification and the application of dry dressings,
 39718	with a view to avoiding the onset of moist gangrene. After granulations
 39719	have formed, skin-grafting is of value in hastening healing.
 39720	
 39721	#Lightning-stroke.#--In a large proportion of cases lightning-stroke
 39722	proves instantly fatal. In non-fatal cases the patient suffers from a
 39723	profound degree of shock, and there may or may not be any external
 39724	evidence of injury. In the mildest cases red spots or wheals--closely
 39725	resembling those of urticaria--may appear on the body, but they usually
 39726	fade again in the course of twenty-four hours. Sometimes large patches
 39727	of skin are scorched or stained, the discoloured area showing an
 39728	arborescent appearance. In other cases the injured skin becomes dry and
 39729	glazed, resembling parchment. Appearances are occasionally met with
 39730	corresponding to those of a superficial burn produced by heat. The chief
 39731	difference from ordinary burns is the extreme slowness with which
 39732	healing takes place. Localised paralysis of groups of muscles, or even
 39733	of a whole limb, may follow any degree of lightning-stroke. Treatment is
 39734	mainly directed towards combating the shock, the surface-lesions being
 39735	treated on the same lines as ordinary burns.

 39740	CHAPTER XII
 39741	
 39742	METHODS OF WOUND TREATMENT
 39743	
 39744	
 39745	Varieties of wounds--Modes of infection--Lister's work--Means taken to
 39746	    prevent infection of wounds: _heat_; _chemical antiseptics_;
 39747	    _disinfection of hands_; _preparation of skin of patient_;
 39748	    _instruments_; _ligatures_; _dressings_--Means taken to combat
 39749	    infection: _purification_; _open-wound method_.
 39750	
 39751	The surgeon is called upon to treat two distinct classes of wounds: (1)
 39752	those resulting from injury or disease in which _the skin is already
 39753	broken_, or in which a communication with a mucous surface exists; and
 39754	(2) those that he himself makes _through intact skin_, no infected
 39755	mucous surface being involved.
 39756	
 39757	Infection by bacteria must be assumed to have taken place in all wounds
 39758	made in any other way than by the knife of the surgeon operating through
 39759	unbroken skin. On this assumption the modern system of wound treatment
 39760	is based. Pathogenic bacteria are so widely distributed, that in the
 39761	ordinary circumstances of everyday life, no matter how trivial a wound
 39762	may be, or how short a time it may remain exposed, the access of
 39763	organisms to it is almost certain unless preventive measures are
 39764	employed.
 39765	
 39766	It cannot be emphasised too strongly that rigid precautions are to be
 39767	taken to exclude fresh infection, not only in dealing with wounds that
 39768	are free of organisms, but equally in the management of wounds and other
 39769	lesions that are already infected. Any laxity in our methods which
 39770	admits of fresh organisms reaching an infected wound adds materially to
 39771	the severity of the infective process and consequently to the patient's
 39772	risk.
 39773	
 39774	There are many ways in which accidental infection may occur. Take, for
 39775	example, the case of a person who receives a cut on the face by being
 39776	knocked down in a carriage accident on the street. Organisms may be
 39777	introduced to such a wound from the shaft or wheel by which he was
 39778	struck, from the ground on which he lay, from any portion of his
 39779	clothing that may have come in contact with the wound, or from his own
 39780	skin. Or, again, the hands of those who render first aid, the water used
 39781	to bathe the wound, the handkerchief or other extemporised dressing
 39782	applied to it, may be the means of conveying bacterial infection. Should
 39783	the wound open on a mucous surface, such as the mouth or nasal cavity,
 39784	the organisms constantly present in such situations are liable to prove
 39785	agents of infection.
 39786	
 39787	Even after the patient has come under professional care the risks of his
 39788	wound becoming infected are not past, because the hands of the doctor,
 39789	his instruments, dressings, or other appliances may all, unless
 39790	purified, become the sources of infection.
 39791	
 39792	In the case of an operation carried out through unbroken skin, organisms
 39793	may be introduced into the wound from the patient's own skin, from the
 39794	hands of the surgeon or his assistants, through the medium of
 39795	contaminated instruments, swabs, ligature or suture materials, or other
 39796	things used in the course of the operation, or from the dressings
 39797	applied to the wound.
 39798	
 39799	Further, bacteria may gain access to devitalised tissues by way of the
 39800	blood-stream, being carried hither from some infected area elsewhere in
 39801	the body.
 39802	
 39803	_The Antiseptic System of Surgery._--Those who only know the surgical
 39804	conditions of to-day can scarcely realise the state of matters which
 39805	existed before the introduction of the antiseptic system by Joseph
 39806	Lister in 1867. In those days few wounds escaped the ravages of pyogenic
 39807	and other bacteria, with the result that suppuration ensued after most
 39808	operations, and such diseases as erysipelas, pyaemia, and "hospital
 39809	gangrene" were of everyday occurrence. The mortality after compound
 39810	fractures, amputations, and many other operations was appalling, and
 39811	death from blood-poisoning frequently followed even the most trivial
 39812	operations. An operation was looked upon as a last resource, and the
 39813	inherent risk from blood-poisoning seemed to have set an impassable
 39814	barrier to the further progress of surgery. To the genius of Lister we
 39815	owe it that this barrier was removed. Having satisfied himself that the
 39816	septic process was due to bacterial infection, he devised a means of
 39817	preventing the access of organisms to wounds or of counteracting their
 39818	effects. Carbolic acid was the first antiseptic agent he employed, and
 39819	by its use in compound fractures he soon obtained results such as had
 39820	never before been attained. The principle was applied to other
 39821	conditions with like success, and so profoundly has it affected the
 39822	whole aspect of surgical pathology, that many of the infective diseases
 39823	with which surgeons formerly had to deal are now all but unknown. The
 39824	broad principles upon which Lister founded his system remain unchanged,
 39825	although the methods employed to put them into practice have been
 39826	modified.
 39827	
 39828	#Means taken to Prevent Infection of Wounds.#--The avenues by which
 39829	infective agents may gain access to surgical wounds are so numerous and
 39830	so wide, that it requires the greatest care and the most watchful
 39831	attention on the part of the surgeon to guard them all. It is only by
 39832	constant practice and patient attention to technical details in the
 39833	operating room and at the bedside, that the carrying out of surgical
 39834	manipulations in such a way as to avoid bacterial infection will become
 39835	an instinctive act and a second nature. It is only possible here to
 39836	indicate the chief directions in which danger lies, and to describe the
 39837	means most generally adopted to avoid it.
 39838	
 39839	To prevent infection, it is essential that everything which comes into
 39840	contact with a wound should be sterilised or disinfected, and to ensure
 39841	the best results it is necessary that the efficiency of our methods of
 39842	sterilisation should be periodically tested. The two chief agencies at
 39843	our disposal are heat and chemical antiseptics.
 39844	
 39845	#Sterilisation by Heat.#--The most reliable, and at the same time the
 39846	most convenient and generally applicable, means of sterilisation is by
 39847	heat. All bacteria and spores are completely destroyed by being
 39848	subjected for fifteen minutes to _saturated circulating steam_ at a
 39849	temperature of 130 o to 145 o C. (= 266 o to 293 o F.). The articles to be
 39850	sterilised are enclosed in a perforated tin casket, which is placed in a
 39851	specially constructed steriliser, such as that of Schimmelbusch. This
 39852	apparatus is so arranged that the steam circulates under a pressure of
 39853	from two to three atmospheres, and permeates everything contained in it.
 39854	Objects so sterilised are dry when removed from the steriliser. This
 39855	method is specially suitable for appliances which are not damaged by
 39856	steam, such, for example, as gauze swabs, towels, aprons, gloves, and
 39857	metal instruments; it is essential that the efficiency of the steriliser
 39858	be tested from time to time by a self-registering thermometer or other
 39859	means.
 39860	
 39861	The best substitute for circulating steam is _boiling_. The articles are
 39862	placed in a "fish-kettle steriliser" and boiled for fifteen minutes in a
 39863	1 per cent. solution of washing soda.
 39864	
 39865	To prevent contamination of objects that have been sterilised they must
 39866	on no account be touched by any one whose hands have not been
 39867	disinfected and protected by sterilised gloves.
 39868	
 39869	#Sterilisation by Chemical Agents.#--For the purification of the skin of
 39870	the patient, the hands of the surgeon, and knives and other instruments
 39871	that are damaged by heat, recourse must be had to chemical agents.
 39872	These, however, are less reliable than heat, and are open to certain
 39873	other objections.
 39874	
 39875	#Disinfection of the Hands.#--It is now generally recognised that one of
 39876	the most likely sources of wound infection is the hands of the surgeon
 39877	and his assistants. It is only by carefully studying to avoid all
 39878	contact with infective matter that the hands can be kept surgically
 39879	pure, and that this source of wound infection can be reduced to a
 39880	minimum. The risk of infection from this source has further been greatly
 39881	reduced by the systematic use of rubber gloves by house-surgeons,
 39882	dressers, and nurses. The habitual use of gloves has also been adopted
 39883	by the great majority of surgeons; the minority, who find they are
 39884	handicapped by wearing gloves as a routine measure, are obliged to do so
 39885	when operating in infective cases or dressing infected wounds, and in
 39886	making rectal and vaginal examinations.
 39887	
 39888	The gloves may be sterilised by steam, and are then put on dry, or by
 39889	boiling, in which case they are put on wet. The gauntlet of the glove
 39890	should overlap and confine the end of the sleeve of the sterilised
 39891	overall, and the gloved hands are rinsed in lotion before and at
 39892	frequent intervals during the operation. The hands are sterilised before
 39893	putting on the gloves, preferably by a method which dehydrates the skin.
 39894	Cotton gloves may be worn by the surgeon when tying ligatures, or
 39895	between operations, and by the anaesthetist during operations on the
 39896	head, neck, and chest.
 39897	
 39898	The first step in the disinfection of the hands is the mechanical
 39899	removal of gross surface dirt and loose epithelium by soap, a stream of
 39900	running water as hot as can be borne, and a loofah or nail-brush, that
 39901	has been previously sterilised by heat. The nails should be cut down
 39902	till there is no sulcus between the nail edge and the pulp of the finger
 39903	in which organisms may lodge. They are next washed for three minutes in
 39904	methylated spirit to dehydrate the skin, and then for two or three
 39905	minutes in 70 per cent. sublimate or biniodide alcohol (1 in 1000).
 39906	Finally, the hands are rubbed with dry sterilised gauze.
 39907	
 39908	#Preparation of the Skin of the Patient.#--In the purification of the
 39909	skin of the patient before operation, reliance is to be placed chiefly
 39910	in the mechanical removal of dirt and grease by the same means as are
 39911	taken for the cleansing of the surgeon's hands. Hair-covered parts
 39912	should be shaved. The skin is then dehydrated by washing with methylated
 39913	spirit, followed by 70 per cent. sublimate or biniodide alcohol (1 in
 39914	1000). This is done some hours before the operation, and the part is
 39915	then covered with pads of dry sterilised gauze or a sterilised towel.
 39916	Immediately before the operation the skin is again purified in the same
 39917	way.
 39918	
 39919	The _iodine method_ of disinfecting the skin introduced by Grossich is
 39920	simple, and equally efficient. The day before operation the skin, after
 39921	being washed with soap and water, is shaved, dehydrated by means of
 39922	methylated spirit, and then painted with a 5 per cent. solution of
 39923	iodine in rectified spirit. The painting with iodine is repeated just
 39924	before the operation commences, and again after it is completed. The
 39925	final application is omitted in the case of children. In emergency
 39926	operations the skin is shaved dry and dehydrated with spirit, after
 39927	which the iodine is applied as described above. The staining of the skin
 39928	is an advantage, as it enables the operator to recognise the area that
 39929	has been prepared.
 39930	
 39931	If any acne pustules or infected sinuses are present, they should be
 39932	destroyed or purified by means of the thermo-cautery or pure carbolic
 39933	acid, after the patient is anaesthetised.
 39934	
 39935	#Appliances used at Operation.#--_Instruments_ that are not damaged by
 39936	heat must be boiled in a fish-kettle or other suitable steriliser for
 39937	fifteen minutes in a 1 per cent. solution of cresol or washing soda.
 39938	Just before the operation begins they are removed in the tray of the
 39939	steriliser and placed on a sterilised towel within reach of the surgeon
 39940	or his assistant. Knives and instruments that are liable to be damaged
 39941	by heat should be purified by being soaked in pure cresol for a few
 39942	minutes, or in 1 in 20 carbolic for at least an hour.
 39943	
 39944	_Pads of Gauze_ sterilised by compressed circulating steam have almost
 39945	entirely superseded marine sponges for operative purposes. To avoid the
 39946	risk of leaving swabs in the peritoneal cavity, large square pads of
 39947	gauze, to one corner of which a piece of strong tape about a foot long
 39948	is securely stitched, should be employed. They should be removed from
 39949	the caskets in which they are sterilised by means of sterilised forceps,
 39950	and handed direct to the surgeon. The assistant who attends to the swabs
 39951	should wear sterilised gloves.
 39952	
 39953	_Ligatures and Sutures._--To avoid the risk of implanting infective
 39954	matter in a wound by means of the materials used for ligatures and
 39955	sutures, great care must be taken in their preparation.
 39956	
 39957	_Catgut._--The following methods of preparing catgut have proved
 39958	satisfactory: (1) The gut is soaked in juniper oil for at least a month;
 39959	the juniper oil is then removed by ether and alcohol, and the gut
 39960	preserved in 1 in 1000 solution of corrosive sublimate in alcohol
 39961	(Kocher). (2) The gut is placed in a brass receiver and boiled for
 39962	three-quarters of an hour in a solution consisting of 85 per cent.
 39963	absolute alcohol, 10 per cent. water, and 5 per cent. carbolic acid, and
 39964	is then stored in 90 per cent. alcohol. (3) Cladius recommends that the
 39965	catgut, just as it is bought from the dealers, be loosely rolled on a
 39966	spool, and then immersed in a solution of--iodine, 1 part; iodide of
 39967	potassium, 1 part; distilled water, 100 parts. At the end of eight days
 39968	it is ready for use. Moschcowitz has found that the tensile strength of
 39969	catgut so prepared is increased if it is kept dry in a sterile vessel,
 39970	instead of being left indefinitely in the iodine solution. If
 39971	Salkindsohn's formula is used--tincture of iodine, 1 part; proof spirit,
 39972	15 parts--the gut can be kept permanently in the solution without
 39973	becoming brittle. To avoid contamination from the hands, catgut should
 39974	be removed from the bottle with aseptic forceps and passed direct to the
 39975	surgeon. Any portion unused should be thrown away.
 39976	
 39977	_Silk_ is prepared by being soaked for twelve hours in ether, for other
 39978	twelve in alcohol, and then boiled for ten minutes in 1 in 1000
 39979	sublimate solution. It is then wound on spools with purified hands
 39980	protected by sterilised gloves, and kept in absolute alcohol. Before an
 39981	operation the silk is again boiled for ten minutes in the same solution,
 39982	and is used directly from this (Kocher). Linen thread is sterilised in
 39983	the same way as silk.
 39984	
 39985	Fishing-gut and silver wire, as well as the needles, should be boiled
 39986	along with the instruments. Horse-hair and fishing-gut may be sterilised
 39987	by prolonged immersion in 1 in 20 carbolic, or in the iodine solutions
 39988	employed to sterilise catgut.
 39989	
 39990	The field of operation is surrounded by sterilised towels, clipped to
 39991	the edges of the wound, and securely fixed in position so that no
 39992	contamination may take place from the surroundings.
 39993	
 39994	The surgeon and his assistants, including the anaesthetist, wear
 39995	overalls sterilised by steam. To avoid the risk of infection from dust,
 39996	scurf, or drops of perspiration falling from the head, the surgeon and
 39997	his assistants may wear sterilised cotton caps. To obviate the risk of
 39998	infection taking place by drops of saliva projected from the mouth in
 39999	talking or coughing in the vicinity of a wound, a simple mask may be
 40000	worn.
 40001	
 40002	The risk of infection from the _air_ is now known to be very small, so
 40003	long as there is no excess of floating dust. All sweeping, dusting, and
 40004	disturbing of curtains, blinds, or furniture must therefore be avoided
 40005	before or during an operation.
 40006	
 40007	It has been shown that the presence of spectators increases the number
 40008	of organisms in the atmosphere. In teaching clinics, therefore, the risk
 40009	from air infection is greater than in private practice.
 40010	
 40011	To facilitate primary union, all haemorrhage should be arrested, and the
 40012	accumulation of fluid in the wound prevented. When much oozing is
 40013	anticipated, a glass or rubber drainage-tube is inserted through a small
 40014	opening specially made for the purpose. In aseptic wounds the tube may
 40015	be removed in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and where it is
 40016	important to avoid a scar, the opening should be closed with a Michel's
 40017	clip; in infected wounds the tube must remain as long as the discharge
 40018	continues.
 40019	
 40020	The fascia and skin should be brought into accurate apposition by
 40021	sutures. If any cavity exists in the deeper part of the wound it should
 40022	be obliterated by buried sutures, or by so adjusting the dressing as to
 40023	bring its walls into apposition.
 40024	
 40025	If these precautions have been successful, the wound will heal under the
 40026	original dressing, which need not be interfered with for from seven to
 40027	ten days, according to the nature of the case.
 40028	
 40029	#Dressings.#--_Gauze_, sterilised by heat, is almost universally
 40030	employed for the dressing of wounds. _Double cyanide gauze_ may be used
 40031	in such regions as the neck, axilla, or groin, where complete
 40032	sterilisation of the skin is difficult to attain, and where it is
 40033	desirable to leave the dressing undisturbed for ten days or more.
 40034	_Iodoform_ or _bismuth gauze_ is of special value for the packing of
 40035	wounds treated by the open method.
 40036	
 40037	One variety or another of _wool_, rendered absorbent by the extraction
 40038	of its fat, and sterilised by heat, forms a part of almost every
 40039	surgical dressing, and various antiseptic agents may be added to it. Of
 40040	these, corrosive sublimate is the most generally used. Wood-wool
 40041	dressings are more highly and more uniformly absorbent than cotton
 40042	wools. As evaporation takes place through wool dressings, the discharge
 40043	becomes dried, and so forms an unfavourable medium for bacterial growth.
 40044	
 40045	Pads of _sphagnum moss_, sterilised by heat, are highly absorbent, and
 40046	being economical are used when there is much discharge, and in cases
 40047	where a leakage of urine has to be soaked up.
 40048	
 40049	#Means adopted to combat Infection.#--As has already been indicated, the
 40050	same antiseptic precautions are to be taken in dealing with infected as
 40051	with aseptic wounds.
 40052	
 40053	In _recent injuries_ such as result from railway or machinery accidents,
 40054	with bruising and crushing of the tissues and grinding of gross dirt
 40055	into the wounds, the scissors must be freely used to remove the tissues
 40056	that have been devitalised or impregnated with foreign material.
 40057	Hair-covered parts should be shaved and the surrounding skin painted
 40058	with iodine. Crushed and contaminated portions of bone should be
 40059	chiselled away. Opinions differ as to the benefit derived from washing
 40060	such wounds with chemical antiseptics, which are liable to devitalise
 40061	the tissues with which they come in contact, and so render them less
 40062	able to resist the action of any organisms that may remain in them. All
 40063	are agreed, however, that free washing with normal salt solution is
 40064	useful in mechanically cleansing the injured parts. Peroxide of hydrogen
 40065	sprayed over such wounds is also beneficial in virtue of its oxidising
 40066	properties. Efficient drainage must be provided, and stitches should be
 40067	used sparingly, if at all.
 40068	
 40069	The best way in which to treat such wounds is by the _open method_. This
 40070	consists in packing the wound with iodoform or bismuth gauze, which is
 40071	left in position as long as it adheres to the raw surface. The packing
 40072	may be renewed at intervals until the wound is filled by granulations;
 40073	or, in the course of a few days when it becomes evident that the
 40074	infection has been overcome, _secondary_ sutures may be introduced and
 40075	the edges drawn together, provision being made at the ends for further
 40076	packing or for drainage-tubes.
 40077	
 40078	If earth or street dirt has entered the wound, the surface may with
 40079	advantage be painted over with pure carbolic acid, as virulent
 40080	organisms, such as those of tetanus or spreading gangrene, are liable to
 40081	be present. Prophylactic injection of tetanus antitoxin may be
 40082	indicated.

 40095	
 40096	
 40097	SYNCOPE, SHOCK, AND COLLAPSE
 40098	
 40099	Syncope, shock, and collapse are clinical conditions which, although
 40100	depending on different causes, bear a superficial resemblance to one
 40101	another.
 40102	
 40103	#Syncope or Fainting.#--Syncope is the result of a suddenly produced
 40104	anaemia of the brain from temporary weakening or arrest of the heart's
 40105	action. In surgical practice, this condition is usually observed in
 40106	nervous persons who have been subjected to pain, as in the reduction of
 40107	a dislocation or the incision of a whitlow; or in those who have rapidly
 40108	lost a considerable quantity of blood. It may also follow the sudden
 40109	withdrawal of fluid from a large cavity, as in tapping an abdomen for
 40110	ascites, or withdrawing fluid from the pleural cavity. Syncope sometimes
 40111	occurs also during the administration of a general anaesthetic,
 40112	especially if there is a tendency to sickness and the patient is not
 40113	completely under. During an operation the onset of syncope is often
 40114	recognised by the cessation of oozing from the divided vessels before
 40115	the general symptoms become manifest.
 40116	
 40117	_Clinical Features._--When a person is about to faint he feels giddy,
 40118	has surging sounds in his ears, and haziness of vision; he yawns,
 40119	becomes pale and sick, and a free flow of saliva takes place into the
 40120	mouth. The pupils dilate; the pulse becomes small and almost
 40121	imperceptible; the respirations shallow and hurried; consciousness
 40122	gradually fades away, and he falls in a heap on the floor.
 40123	
 40124	Sometimes vomiting ensues before the patient completely loses
 40125	consciousness, and the muscular exertion entailed may ward off the
 40126	actual faint. This is frequently seen in threatened syncopal attacks
 40127	during chloroform administration.
 40128	
 40129	Recovery begins in a few seconds, the patient sighing or gasping, or, it
 40130	may be, vomiting; the strength of the pulse gradually increases, and
 40131	consciousness slowly returns. In some cases, however, syncope is fatal.
 40132	
 40133	_Treatment._--The head should at once be lowered--in imitation of
 40134	nature's method--to encourage the flow of blood to the brain, the
 40135	patient, if necessary, being held up by the heels. All tight clothing,
 40136	especially round the neck or chest, must be loosened. The heart may be
 40137	stimulated reflexly by dashing cold water over the face or chest, or by
 40138	rubbing the face vigorously with a rough towel. The application of
 40139	volatile substances, such as ammonia or smelling-salts, to the nose; the
 40140	administration by the mouth of sal-volatile, whisky or brandy, and the
 40141	intra-muscular injection of ether, are the most speedily efficacious
 40142	remedies. In severe cases the application of hot cloths over the heart,
 40143	or of the faradic current over the line of the phrenic nerve, just above
 40144	the clavicle, may be called for.
 40145	
 40146	#Surgical Shock.#--The condition known as surgical shock may be looked
 40147	upon as a state of profound exhaustion of the mechanism that exists in
 40148	the body for the transformation of energy. This mechanism consists of
 40149	(1) the _brain_, which, through certain special centres, regulates all
 40150	vital activity; (2) the _adrenal glands_, the secretion of
 40151	which--adrenalin--acting as a stimulant of the sympathetic system, so
 40152	controls the tone of the blood vessels as to maintain efficient
 40153	oxidation of the tissues; and (3) _the liver_, which stores and delivers
 40154	glycogen as it is required by the muscles, and in addition, deals with
 40155	the by-products of metabolism.
 40156	
 40157	Crile and his co-workers have shown that in surgical shock histological
 40158	changes occur in the cells of the brain, the adrenals, and the liver,
 40159	and that these are identical, whatever be the cause that leads to the
 40160	exhaustion of the energy-transforming mechanism. These changes vary in
 40161	degree, and range from slight alterations in the structure of the
 40162	protoplasm to complete disorganisation of the cell elements.
 40163	
 40164	The influences which contribute to bring about this form of exhaustion
 40165	that we call shock are varied, and include such emotional states as
 40166	fear, anxiety, or worry, physical injury and toxic infection, and the
 40167	effects of these factors are augmented by anything that tends to lower
 40168	the vitality, such as loss of blood, exposure, insufficient food, loss
 40169	of sleep or antecedent illness.
 40170	
 40171	Any one or any combination of these influences may cause shock, but the
 40172	most potent, and the one which most concerns the surgeon, is physical
 40173	injury, _e.g._, a severe accident or an operation (_traumatic shock_).
 40174	This is usually associated with some emotional disturbance, such as fear
 40175	or anxiety (_emotional shock_), or with haemorrhage; and may be followed
 40176	by septic infection (_toxic shock_).
 40177	
 40178	The exaggerated afferent impulses reaching the brain as a result of
 40179	trauma, inhibit the action of the nuclei in the region of the fourth
 40180	ventricle and cerebellum which maintain the muscular tone, with the
 40181	result that the muscular tone is diminished and there is a marked fall
 40182	in the arterial blood pressure. The capillaries dilate--the blood
 40183	stagnating in them and giving off its oxygen and transuding its fluid
 40184	elements into the tissues--with the result that an insufficient quantity
 40185	of oxygenated blood reaches the heart to enable it to maintain an
 40186	efficient circulation. As the sarco-lactic acid liberated in the muscles
 40187	is not oxygenated a condition of acidosis ensues.
 40188	
 40189	The more highly the injured part is endowed with sensory nerves the more
 40190	marked is the shock; a crush of the hand, for example, is attended with
 40191	a more intense degree of shock than a correspondingly severe crush of
 40192	the foot; and injuries of such specially innervated parts as the testis,
 40193	the urethra, the face, or the spinal cord, are associated with severe
 40194	degrees, as are also those of parts innervated from the sympathetic
 40195	system, such as the abdominal or thoracic viscera. It is to be borne in
 40196	mind that a state of general anaesthesia does not prevent injurious
 40197	impulses reaching the brain and causing shock during an operation. If
 40198	the main nerves of the part are "blocked" by injection of a local
 40199	anaesthetic, however, the central nervous system is protected from these
 40200	impulses.
 40201	
 40202	While the aged frequently manifest but few signs of shock, they have a
 40203	correspondingly feeble power of recovery; and while many young children
 40204	suffer little, even after severe operations, others with much less cause
 40205	succumb to shock.
 40206	
 40207	When the injured person's mind is absorbed with other matters than his
 40208	own condition,--as, for example, during the heat of a battle or in the
 40209	excitement of a railway accident or a conflagration,--even severe
 40210	injuries may be unattended by pain or shock at the time, although when
 40211	the period of excitement is over, the severity of the shock is all the
 40212	greater. The same thing is observed in persons injured while under the
 40213	influence of alcohol.
 40214	
 40215	_Clinical Features._--The patient is in a state of prostration. He is
 40216	roused from his condition of indifference with difficulty, but answers
 40217	questions intelligently, if only in a whisper. The face is pale, beads
 40218	of sweat stand out on the brow, the features are drawn, the eyes
 40219	sunken, and the cheeks hollow. The lips and ears are pallid; the skin of
 40220	the body of a greyish colour, cold, and clammy. The pulse is rapid,
 40221	fluttering, and often all but imperceptible at the wrist; the
 40222	respiration is irregular, shallow, and sighing; and the temperature may
 40223	fall to 96 o F. or even lower. The mouth is parched, and the patient
 40224	complains of thirst. There is little sensibility to pain.
 40225	
 40226	Except in very severe cases, shock tends towards recovery within a few
 40227	hours, the _reaction_, as it is called, being often ushered in by
 40228	vomiting. The colour improves; the pulse becomes full and bounding; the
 40229	respiration deeper and more regular; the temperature rises to 100 o F. or
 40230	higher; and the patient begins to take notice of his surroundings. The
 40231	condition of neurasthenia which sometimes follows an operation may be
 40232	associated with the degenerative changes in nerve cells described by
 40233	Crile.
 40234	
 40235	In certain cases the symptoms of traumatic shock blend with those
 40236	resulting from toxin absorption, and it is difficult to estimate the
 40237	relative importance of the two factors in the causation of the
 40238	condition. The conditions formerly known as "delayed shock" and
 40239	"prostration with excitement" are now generally recognised to be due to
 40240	toxaemia.
 40241	
 40242	_Question of Operating during Shock._--Most authorities agree that
 40243	operations should only be undertaken during profound shock when they are
 40244	imperatively demanded for the arrest of haemorrhage, the prevention of
 40245	infection of serous cavities, or for the relief of pain which is
 40246	producing or intensifying the condition.
 40247	
 40248	_Prevention of Operation Shock._--In the preparation of a patient for
 40249	operation, drastic purgation and prolonged fasting must be avoided, and
 40250	about half an hour before a severe operation a pint of saline solution
 40251	should be slowly introduced into the rectum; this is repeated, if
 40252	necessary, during the operation, and at its conclusion. The
 40253	operating-room must be warm--not less than 70 o F.--and the patient
 40254	should be wrapped in cotton wool and blankets, and surrounded by
 40255	hot-bottles. All lotions used must be warm (100 o F.); and the operation
 40256	should be completed as speedily and as bloodlessly as possible. The
 40257	element of fear may to some extent be eliminated by the preliminary
 40258	administration of such drugs as scopolamin or morphin, and with a view
 40259	to preventing the passage of exciting afferent impulses, Crile advocates
 40260	"blocking" of the nerves by the injection of a 1 per cent. solution of
 40261	novocaine into their substance on the proximal side of the field of
 40262	operation. To prevent after-pain in abdominal wounds he recommends
 40263	injecting the edges with quinine and urea hydrochlorate before suturing,
 40264	the resulting anaesthesia lasting for twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
 40265	To these preventive measures the term _anoci-association_ has been
 40266	applied. In selecting an anaesthetic, it may be borne in mind that
 40267	chloroform lowers the blood pressure more than ether does, and that with
 40268	spinal anaesthesia there is no lowering of the blood pressure.
 40269	
 40270	_Treatment._--A patient suffering from shock should be placed in the
 40271	recumbent position, with the foot of the bed raised to facilitate the
 40272	return circulation in the large veins, and so to increase the flow of
 40273	blood to the brain. His bed should be placed near a large fire, and the
 40274	patient himself surrounded by cotton wool and blankets and hot-bottles.
 40275	If he has lost much blood, the limbs should be wrapped in cotton wool
 40276	and firmly bandaged from below upwards, to conserve as much of the
 40277	circulating blood as possible in the trunk and head. If the shock is
 40278	moderate in degree, as soon as the patient has been put to bed, about a
 40279	pint of saline solution should be introduced into the rectum, and 10 to
 40280	15 minims of adrenalin chloride (1 in 1000) may with advantage be added
 40281	to the fluid. The injection should be repeated every two hours until the
 40282	circulation is sufficiently restored. In severe cases, especially when
 40283	associated with haemorrhage, transfusion of whole blood from a compatible
 40284	donor, is the most efficient means (_Op. Surg._, p. 37). Cardiac
 40285	stimulants such as strychnin, digitalin, or strophanthin are
 40286	contra-indicated in shock, as they merely exhaust the already impaired
 40287	vaso-motor centre.
 40288	
 40289	Artificial respiration may be useful in tiding a patient over the
 40290	critical period of shock, especially at the end of a severe operation.
 40291	
 40292	Failing this, the introduction of saline solution at a temperature of
 40293	about 105 o F. into a vein or into the subcutaneous tissue is useful
 40294	where much blood has been lost (p. 276). Two or three pints may be
 40295	injected into a vein, or smaller quantities under the skin.
 40296	
 40297	Thirst is best met by giving small quantities of warm water by the
 40298	mouth, or by the introduction of saline solution into the rectum. Ice
 40299	only relieves thirst for a short time, and as it is liable to induce
 40300	flatulence should be avoided, especially in abdominal cases. Dryness of
 40301	the tongue may be relieved by swabbing the mouth with a mixture of
 40302	glycerine and lemon juice.
 40303	
 40304	If severe pain calls for the use of morphin, 1/120th grain of atropin
 40305	should be added, or heroin alone may be given in doses of 1/24th to
 40306	1/12th grain.
 40307	
 40308	#Collapse# is a clinical condition which comes on more insidiously than
 40309	shock, and which does not attain its maximum degree of severity for
 40310	several hours. It is met with in the course of severe illnesses,
 40311	especially such as are associated with the loss of large quantities of
 40312	fluid from the body--for example, by severe diarrhoea, notably in Asiatic
 40313	cholera; by persistent vomiting; or by profuse sweating, as in some
 40314	cases of heat-stroke. Severe degrees of collapse follow sudden and
 40315	profuse loss of blood.
 40316	
 40317	Collapse often follows upon shock--for example, in intestinal
 40318	perforations, or after abdominal operations complicated by peritonitis,
 40319	especially if there is vomiting, as in cases of obstruction high up in
 40320	the intestine. The symptoms of collapse are aggravated if toxin
 40321	absorption is superadded to the loss of fluid.
 40322	
 40323	The _clinical features_ of this condition are practically the same as
 40324	those of shock; and it is treated on the same lines.
 40325	
 40326	FAT EMBOLISM.--After various injuries and operations, but
 40327	especially such as implicate the marrow of long bones--for example,
 40328	comminuted fractures, osteotomies, resections of joints, or the forcible
 40329	correction of deformities--fluid fat may enter the circulation in
 40330	variable quantity. In the vast majority of cases no ill effects follow,
 40331	but when the quantity is large or when the absorption is long continued
 40332	certain symptoms ensue, either immediately, or more frequently not for
 40333	two or three days. These are mostly referable to the lungs and brain.
 40334	
 40335	In the lung the fat collects in the minute blood vessels and produces
 40336	venous congestion and oedema, and sometimes pneumonia. Dyspnoea, with
 40337	cyanosis, a persistent cough and frothy or blood-stained sputum, a
 40338	feeble pulse and low temperature, are the chief symptoms.
 40339	
 40340	When the fat lodges in the capillaries of the brain, the pulse becomes
 40341	small, rapid, and irregular, delirium followed by coma ensues, and the
 40342	condition is usually rapidly fatal.
 40343	
 40344	Fat is usually to be detected in the urine, even in mild cases.
 40345	
 40346	The _treatment_ consists in tiding the patient over the acute stage of
 40347	his illness, until the fat is eliminated from the blood vessels.
 40348	
 40349	TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA OR TRAUMATIC CYANOSIS.--This term has been
 40350	applied to a condition which results when the thorax is so forcibly
 40351	compressed that respiration is mechanically arrested for several
 40352	minutes. It has occurred from being crushed in a struggling crowd, or
 40353	under a fall of masonry, and in machinery accidents. When the patient is
 40354	released, the face and the neck as low down as the level of the
 40355	clavicles present an intense coloration, varying from deep purple to
 40356	blue-black. The affected area is sharply defined, and on close
 40357	inspection the appearance is found to be due to the presence of
 40358	countless minute reddish-blue or black spots, with small areas or
 40359	streaks of normal skin between them. The punctate nature of the
 40360	coloration is best recognised towards the periphery of the affected
 40361	area--at the junction of the brow with the hairy scalp, and where the
 40362	dark patch meets the normal skin of the chest (Beach and Cobb). Pressure
 40363	over the skin does not cause the colour to disappear as in ordinary
 40364	cyanosis. It has been shown by Wright of Boston, that the coloration is
 40365	due to stasis from mechanical over-distension of the veins and
 40366	capillaries; actual extravasation into the tissues is exceptional. The
 40367	sharply defined distribution of the coloration is attributed to the
 40368	absence of functionating valves in the veins of the head and neck, so
 40369	that when the increased intra-thoracic pressure is transmitted to these
 40370	veins they become engorged. Under the conjunctivae there are
 40371	extravasations of bright red blood; and sublingual haematoma has been
 40372	observed (Beatson).
 40373	
 40374	The discoloration begins to fade within a few hours, and after the
 40375	second or third day it disappears, without showing any of the chromatic
 40376	changes which characterise a bruise. The sub-conjunctival ecchymosis,
 40377	however, persists for several weeks and disappears like other
 40378	extravasations. Apart from combating the shock, or dealing with
 40379	concomitant injuries, no treatment is called for.

 40384	Delirium is a temporary disturbance of mind which occurs in the course
 40385	of certain diseases, and sometimes after injuries or operations. It may
 40386	be associated with any of the acute pyogenic infections; with
 40387	erysipelas, especially when it affects the head or face; or with chronic
 40388	infective diseases of the urinary organs. In the various forms of
 40389	meningitis also, and in some cases of injury to the head, it is common;
 40390	and it is sometimes met with after severe haemorrhage, and in cases of
 40391	poisoning by such drugs as iodoform, cocain, or alcohol. Delirium may
 40392	also, of course, be a symptom of insanity.
 40393	
 40394	Often there is merely incoherent muttering regarding past incidents or
 40395	occupations, or about absent friends; or the condition may assume the
 40396	form of excitement, of dementia, or of melancholia; and the symptoms are
 40397	usually worst at night.
 40398	
 40399	#Delirium Tremens# is seen in persons addicted to alcohol, who, as the
 40400	result of accident or operation, are suddenly compelled to lie in bed.
 40401	Although oftenest met with in habitual drunkards or chronic tipplers, it
 40402	is by no means uncommon in moderate drinkers, and has even been seen in
 40403	children.
 40404	
 40405	_Clinical Features._--The delirium, which has been aptly described as
 40406	being of a "busy" character, usually manifests itself within a few days
 40407	of the patient being laid up. For two or three days he refuses food, is
 40408	depressed, suspicious, sleepless and restless, demanding to be allowed
 40409	up. Then he begins to mutter incoherently, to pull off the bedclothes,
 40410	and to attempt to get out of bed. There is general muscular tremor, most
 40411	marked in the tongue, the lips, and the hands. The patient imagines that
 40412	he sees all sorts of horrible beings around him, and is sometimes
 40413	greatly distressed because of rats, mice, beetles, or snakes, which he
 40414	fancies are crawling over him. The pulse is soft, rapid, and
 40415	compressible; the temperature is only moderately raised (100 o-101 o F.),
 40416	and as a rule there is profuse sweating. The digestion is markedly
 40417	impaired, and there is often vomiting. Patients in this condition are
 40418	peculiarly insensitive to pain, and may even walk about with a fractured
 40419	leg without apparent discomfort.
 40420	
 40421	In most cases the symptoms begin to pass off in three or four days; the
 40422	patient sleeps, the hallucinations and tremors cease, and he gradually
 40423	recovers. In other cases the temperature rises, the pulse becomes rapid,
 40424	and death results from exhaustion.
 40425	
 40426	The main indication in _treatment_ is to secure sleep, and this is done
 40427	by the administration of bromides, chloral, or paraldehyde, or of one or
 40428	other of the drugs of which sulphonal, trional, and veronal are
 40429	examples. Heroin in doses of from 1/24th to 1/12th grain is often of
 40430	service. Morphin must be used with great caution. In some cases hyoscin
 40431	(1/200 grain) injected hypodermically is found efficacious when all
 40432	other means have failed, but this drug must be used with great
 40433	discrimination. The patient must be encouraged to take plenty of easily
 40434	digested fluid food, supplemented, if necessary, by nutrient enemata and
 40435	saline infusions.
 40436	
 40437	In the early stage a brisk mercurial purge is often of value. Alcohol
 40438	should be withheld, unless failing of the pulse strongly indicates its
 40439	use, and then it should be given along with the food.
 40440	
 40441	A delirious patient must be constantly watched by a trained attendant or
 40442	other competent person, lest he get out of bed and do harm to himself or
 40443	others. Mechanical restraint is often necessary, but must be avoided if
 40444	possible, as it is apt to increase the excitement and exhaust the
 40445	patient. On account of the extreme restlessness, there is often great
 40446	difficulty in carrying out the proper treatment of the primary surgical
 40447	condition, and considerable modifications in splints and other
 40448	appliances are often rendered necessary.
 40449	
 40450	A form of delirium, sometimes spoken of as #Traumatic Delirium#, may
 40451	follow on severe injuries or operations in persons of neurotic
 40452	temperament, or in those whose nervous system is exhausted by overwork.
 40453	It is met with apart from alcoholic intemperance. This form of delirium
 40454	seems to be specially prone to ensue on operations on the face, the
 40455	thyreoid gland, or the genito-urinary organs. The symptoms appear in
 40456	from two to five days after the operation, and take the form of
 40457	restlessness, sleeplessness, low incoherent muttering, and picking at
 40458	the bedclothes. It is not necessarily attended by fever or by muscular
 40459	tremors. The patient may show hysterical symptoms. This condition is
 40460	probably to be regarded as a form of insanity, as it is liable to merge
 40461	into mania or melancholia.
 40462	
 40463	The _treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as that of delirium
 40464	tremens.

 40484	
 40485	#Surgical Anatomy.#--An _artery_ has three coats: an internal coat--the
 40486	_tunica intima_--made up of a single layer of endothelial cells lining
 40487	the lumen; outside of this a layer of delicate connective tissue; and
 40488	still farther out a dense tissue composed of longitudinally arranged
 40489	elastic fibres--the internal elastic lamina. The tunica intima is easily
 40490	ruptured. The middle coat, or _tunica media_, consists of non-striped
 40491	muscular fibres, arranged for the most part concentrically round the
 40492	vessel. In this coat also there is a considerable proportion of elastic
 40493	tissue, especially in the larger vessels. The thickness of the vessel
 40494	wall depends chiefly on the development of the muscular coat. The
 40495	external coat, or _tunica externa_, is composed of fibrous tissue,
 40496	containing, especially in vessels of medium calibre, some yellow elastic
 40497	fibres in its deeper layers.
 40498	
 40499	In most parts of the body the arteries lie in a sheath of connective
 40500	tissue, from which fine fibrous processes pass to the tunica externa.
 40501	The connection, however, is not a close one, and the artery when divided
 40502	transversely is capable of retracting for a considerable distance within
 40503	its sheath. In some of the larger arteries the sheath assumes the form
 40504	of a definite membrane.
 40505	
 40506	The arteries are nourished by small vessels--the _vasa vasorum_--which
 40507	ramify chiefly in the outer coat. They are also well supplied with
 40508	nerves, which regulate the size of the lumen by inducing contraction or
 40509	relaxation of the muscular coat.
 40510	
 40511	The _veins_ are constructed on the same general plan as the arteries,
 40512	the individual coats, however, being thinner. The inner coat is less
 40513	easily ruptured, and the middle coat contains a smaller proportion of
 40514	muscular tissue. In one important point veins differ structurally from
 40515	arteries--namely, in being provided with valves which prevent reflux of
 40516	the blood. These valves are composed of semilunar folds of the tunica
 40517	intima strengthened by an addition of connective tissue. Each valve
 40518	usually consists of two semilunar flaps attached to opposite sides of
 40519	the vessel wall, each flap having a small sinus on its cardiac side.
 40520	The distension of these sinuses with blood closes the valve and
 40521	prevents regurgitation. Valves are absent from the superior and inferior
 40522	venae cavae, the portal vein and its tributaries, the hepatic, renal,
 40523	uterine, and spermatic veins, and from the veins in the lower part of
 40524	the rectum. They are ill-developed or absent also in the iliac and
 40525	common femoral veins--a fact which has an important bearing on the
 40526	production of varix in the veins of the lower extremity.
 40527	
 40528	The wall of _capillaries_ consists of a single layer of endothelial
 40529	cells.
 40530	
 40531	
 40532	HAEMORRHAGE
 40533	
 40534	Various terms are employed in relation to haemorrhage, according to its
 40535	seat, its origin, the time at which it occurs, and other circumstances.
 40536	
 40537	The term _external haemorrhage_ is employed when the blood escapes on the
 40538	surface; when the bleeding takes place into the tissues or into a cavity
 40539	it is spoken of as _internal_. The blood may infiltrate the connective
 40540	tissue, constituting an _extravasation_ of blood; or it may collect in a
 40541	space or cavity and form a _haematoma_.
 40542	
 40543	The coughing up of blood from the lungs is known as _haemoptysis_;
 40544	vomiting of blood from the stomach, as _haematemesis_; the passage of
 40545	black-coloured stools due to the presence of blood altered by digestion,
 40546	as _melaena_; and the passage of bloody urine, as _haematuria_.
 40547	
 40548	Haemorrhage is known as arterial, venous, or capillary, according to the
 40549	nature of the vessel from which it takes place.
 40550	
 40551	In _arterial_ haemorrhage the blood is bright red in colour, and escapes
 40552	from the cardiac end of the divided vessel in pulsating jets
 40553	synchronously with the systole of the heart. In vascular parts--for
 40554	example the face--both ends of a divided artery bleed freely. The blood
 40555	flowing from an artery may be dark in colour if the respiration is
 40556	impeded. When the heart's action is weak and the blood tension low the
 40557	flow may appear to be continuous and not in jets. The blood from a
 40558	divided artery at the bottom of a deep wound, escapes on the surface in
 40559	a steady flow.
 40560	
 40561	_Venous_ bleeding is not pulsatile, but occurs in a continuous stream,
 40562	which, although both ends of the vessel may bleed, is more copious from
 40563	the distal end. The blood is dark red under ordinary conditions, but may
 40564	be purplish, or even black, if the respiration is interfered with. When
 40565	one of the large veins in the neck is wounded, the effects of
 40566	respiration produce a rise and fall in the stream which may resemble
 40567	arterial pulsation.
 40568	
 40569	In _capillary_ haemorrhage, red blood escapes from numerous points on the
 40570	surface of the wound in a steady ooze. This form of bleeding is serious
 40571	in those who are the subjects of haemophilia.
 40572	
 40573	
 40574	INJURIES OF ARTERIES
 40575	
 40576	The following description of the injuries of arteries refers to the
 40577	larger, named trunks. The injuries of smaller, unnamed vessels are
 40578	included in the consideration of wounds and contusions.
 40579	
 40580	#Contusion.#--An artery may be contused by a blow or crush, or by the
 40581	oblique impact of a bullet. The bruising of the vessel wall, especially
 40582	if it is diseased, may result in the formation of a thrombus which
 40583	occludes the lumen temporarily or even permanently, and in rare cases
 40584	may lead to gangrene of the limb beyond.
 40585	
 40586	#Subcutaneous Rupture.#--An artery may be ruptured subcutaneously by a
 40587	blow or crush, or by a displaced fragment of bone. This injury has been
 40588	produced also during attempts to reduce dislocations, especially those
 40589	of old standing at the shoulder. It is most liable to occur when the
 40590	vessels are diseased. The rupture may be incomplete or complete.
 40591	
 40592	_Incomplete Subcutaneous Rupture._--In the majority of cases the rupture
 40593	is incomplete--the inner and middle coats being torn, while the outer
 40594	remains intact. The middle coat contracts and retracts, and the
 40595	internal, because of its elasticity, curls up in the interior of the
 40596	vessel, forming a valvular obstruction to the blood-flow. In most cases
 40597	this results in the formation of a thrombus which occludes the vessel.
 40598	In some cases the blood-pressure gradually distends the injured segment
 40599	of the vessel wall and leads to the formation of an aneurysm.
 40600	
 40601	The pulsation in the vessels beyond the seat of rupture is arrested--for
 40602	a time at least--owing to the occlusion of the vessel, and the limb
 40603	becomes cold and powerless. The pulsation seldom returns within five or
 40604	six weeks of the injury, if indeed it is not permanently arrested, but,
 40605	as a rule, a collateral circulation is rapidly established, sufficient
 40606	to nourish the parts beyond. If the pulsation returns within a week of
 40607	the injury, the presumption is that the occlusion was due to pressure
 40608	from without--for example, by haemorrhage into the sheath or the pressure
 40609	of a fragment of bone.
 40610	
 40611	_Complete Subcutaneous Rupture._--When the rupture is complete, all the
 40612	coats of the vessel are torn and the blood escapes into the surrounding
 40613	tissues. If the original injury is attended with much shock, the
 40614	bleeding may not take place until the period of reaction. Rupture of the
 40615	popliteal artery in association with fracture of the femur, or of the
 40616	axillary or brachial artery with fracture of the humerus or dislocation
 40617	of the shoulder, are familiar examples of this injury.
 40618	
 40619	Like incomplete rupture, this lesion is accompanied by loss of pulsation
 40620	and power, and by coldness of the limb beyond; a tense and excessively
 40621	painful swelling rapidly appears in the region of the injury, and, where
 40622	the cellular tissue is loose, may attain a considerable size. The
 40623	pressure of the effused blood occludes the veins and leads to congestion
 40624	and oedema of the limb beyond. The interference with the circulation, and
 40625	the damage to the tissues, may be so great that gangrene ensues.
 40626	
 40627	_Treatment._--When an artery has been contused or ruptured, the limb
 40628	must be placed in the most favourable condition for restoration of the
 40629	circulation. The skin is disinfected and the limb wrapped in cotton wool
 40630	to conserve its heat, and elevated to such an extent as to promote the
 40631	venous return without at the same time interfering with the inflow of
 40632	blood. A careful watch must be kept on the state of nutrition of the
 40633	limb, lest gangrene occurs.
 40634	
 40635	If no complications supervene, the swelling subsides, and recovery may
 40636	be complete in six or eight weeks. If the extravasation is great and the
 40637	skin threatens to give way, or if the vitality of the limb is seriously
 40638	endangered, it is advisable to expose the injured vessel, and, after
 40639	clearing away the clots, to attempt to suture the rent in the artery,
 40640	or, if torn across, to join the ends after paring the bruised edges. If
 40641	this is impracticable, a ligature is applied above and below the
 40642	rupture. If gangrene ensues, amputation must be performed.
 40643	
 40644	These descriptions apply to the larger arteries of the extremities. A
 40645	good illustration of subcutaneous rupture of the arteries of the head is
 40646	afforded by the tearing of the middle meningeal artery caused by the
 40647	application of blunt violence to the skull; and of the arteries of the
 40648	trunk--caused by the tearing of the renal artery in rupture of the
 40649	kidney.
 40650	
 40651	#Open Wounds of Arteries--Laceration.#--Laceration of large arteries is
 40652	a common complication of machinery and railway accidents. The violence
 40653	being usually of a tearing, twisting, or crushing nature, such injuries
 40654	are seldom associated with much haemorrhage, as torn or crushed vessels
 40655	quickly become occluded by contraction and retraction of their coats and
 40656	by the formation of a clot. A whole limb even may be avulsed from the
 40657	body with comparatively little loss of blood. The risk in such cases is
 40658	secondary haemorrhage resulting from pyogenic infection.
 40659	
 40660	The _treatment_ is that applicable to all wounds, with, in addition, the
 40661	ligation of the lacerated vessels.
 40662	
 40663	#Punctured wounds# of blood vessels may result from stabs, or they may
 40664	be accidentally inflicted in the course of an operation.
 40665	
 40666	The division of the coats of the vessel being incomplete, the natural
 40667	haemostasis that results from curling up of the intima and contraction of
 40668	the media, fails to take place, and bleeding goes on into the
 40669	surrounding tissues, and externally. If the sheath of the vessel is not
 40670	widely damaged, the gradually increasing tension of the extravasated
 40671	blood retained within it may ultimately arrest the haemorrhage. A clot
 40672	then forms between the lips of the wound in the vessel wall and projects
 40673	for a short distance into the lumen, without, however, materially
 40674	interfering with the flow through the vessel. The organisation of this
 40675	clot results in the healing of the wound in the vessel wall.
 40676	
 40677	In other cases the blood escapes beyond the sheath and collects in the
 40678	surrounding tissues, and a traumatic aneurysm results. Secondary
 40679	haemorrhage may occur if the wound becomes infected.
 40680	
 40681	The _treatment_ consists in enlarging the external wound to permit of
 40682	the damaged vessel being ligated above and below the puncture. In some
 40683	cases it may be possible to suture the opening in the vessel wall. When
 40684	circumstances prevent these measures being taken, the bleeding may be
 40685	arrested by making firm pressure over the wound with a pad; but this
 40686	procedure is liable to be followed by the formation of an aneurysm.
 40687	
 40688	_Minute puncture of arteries_ such as frequently occur in the hypodermic
 40689	administration of drugs and in the use of exploring needles, are not
 40690	attended with any escape of blood, chiefly because of the elastic recoil
 40691	of the arterial wall; a tiny thrombus of platelets and thrombus forms at
 40692	the point where the intima is punctured.
 40693	
 40694	#Incised Wounds.#--We here refer only to such incised wounds as partly
 40695	divide the vessel wall.
 40696	
 40697	Longitudinal wounds show little tendency to gape, and are therefore not
 40698	attended with much bleeding. They usually heal rapidly, but, like
 40699	punctured wounds, are liable to be followed by the formation of an
 40700	aneurysm.
 40701	
 40702	When, however, the incision in the vessel wall is oblique or transverse,
 40703	the retraction of the muscular coat causes the opening to gape, with the
 40704	result that there is haemorrhage, which, even in comparatively small
 40705	arteries, may be so profuse as to prove dangerous. When the associated
 40706	wound in the soft parts is valvular the haemorrhage is arrested and an
 40707	aneurysm may develop.
 40708	
 40709	When a large arterial trunk, such as the external iliac, the femoral,
 40710	the common carotid, the brachial, or the popliteal, has been partly
 40711	divided, for example, in the course of an operation, the opening should
 40712	be closed with sutures--_arteriorrhaphy_. The circulation being
 40713	controlled by a tourniquet, or the artery itself occluded by a clamp,
 40714	fine silk or catgut stitches are passed through the outer and middle
 40715	coats after the method of Lembert, a fine, round needle being employed.
 40716	The sheath of the vessel or an adjacent fascia should be stitched
 40717	over the line of suture in the vessel wall. If infection be excluded,
 40718	there is little risk of thrombosis or secondary haemorrhage; and even if
 40719	thrombosis should develop at the point of suture, the artery is
 40720	obstructed gradually, and the establishment of a collateral circulation
 40721	takes place better than after ligation. In the case of smaller trunks,
 40722	or when suture is impracticable, the artery should be tied above and
 40723	below the opening, and divided between the ligatures.
 40724	
 40725	#Gunshot Wounds of Blood Vessels.#--In the majority of cases injuries of
 40726	large vessels are associated with an external wound; the profusion of
 40727	the bleeding indicates the size of the damaged vessel, and the colour of
 40728	the blood and the nature of the flow denote whether an artery or a vein
 40729	is implicated.
 40730	
 40731	When an artery is wounded a firm _haematoma_ may form, with an expansile
 40732	pulsation and a palpable thrill--whether such a haematoma remains
 40733	circumscribed or becomes diffuse depends upon the density or laxity of
 40734	the tissues around it. In course of time a _traumatic arterial aneurysm_
 40735	may develop from such a haematoma.
 40736	
 40737	When an artery and its companion vein are injured simultaneously an
 40738	_arterio-venous aneurysm_ (p. 310) may develop. This frequently takes
 40739	place without the formation of a haematoma as the arterial blood finds
 40740	its way into the vein and so does not escape into the tissues. Even if a
 40741	haematoma forms it seldom assumes a great size. In time a swelling is
 40742	recognised, with a palpable thrill and a systolic bruit, loudest at the
 40743	level of the communication and accompanied by a continuous venous hum.
 40744	
 40745	If leakage occurs into the tissues, the extravasated blood may occlude
 40746	the vein by pressure, and the symptoms of arterial aneurysm replace
 40747	those of the arterio-venous form, the systolic bruit persisting, while
 40748	the venous hum disappears.
 40749	
 40750	_Gangrene_ may ensue if the blood supply is seriously interfered with,
 40751	or the signs of _ischaemia_ may develop; the muscles lose their
 40752	elasticity, become hard and paralysed, and anaesthesia of the "glove" or
 40753	"stocking" type, with other alterations of sensation ensue. Apart from
 40754	ischaemia, _reflex paralysis_ of motion and sensation of a transient kind
 40755	may follow injury of a large vessel.
 40756	
 40757	_Treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as for similar injuries due
 40758	to other causes.
 40759	
 40760	
 40761	INJURIES OF VEINS
 40762	
 40763	Veins are subject to the same forms of injury as arteries, and the
 40764	results are alike in both, such variations as occur being dependent
 40765	partly on the difference in their anatomical structure, and partly on
 40766	the conditions of the circulation through them.
 40767	
 40768	#Subcutaneous rupture# of veins occur most frequently in association
 40769	with fractures and in the reduction of dislocations. The veins most
 40770	commonly ruptured are the popliteal, the axillary, the femoral, and the
 40771	subclavian. On account of the smaller amount of elastic and muscular
 40772	tissue in the wall of a vein, the contraction and retraction of its
 40773	walls are less than in an artery, and so bleeding may continue for a
 40774	longer period. On the other hand, owing to the lower blood-pressure the
 40775	outflow goes on more slowly, and the gradually increasing pressure
 40776	produced by the extravasated blood is usually sufficient to arrest the
 40777	haemorrhage before it becomes serious. As an aid in diagnosing the source
 40778	of the bleeding, it should be remembered that the rupture of a vein does
 40779	not affect the pulsation in the limb beyond. The risks are practically
 40780	the same as when an artery is ruptured, excepting that of aneurysm, and
 40781	the treatment is carried out on the same lines, but it is seldom
 40782	necessary to operate for the purpose of applying a ligature to the
 40783	injured vein.
 40784	
 40785	#Wounds# of veins--punctured and incised--frequently occur in the course
 40786	of operations; for example, in the removal of tumours or diseased glands
 40787	from the neck, the axilla, or the groin. They are also met with as a
 40788	result of accidental stabs and of suicidal or homicidal injuries. The
 40789	haemorrhage from a large vein so damaged is usually profuse, but it is
 40790	more readily controlled by external pressure than that from an artery.
 40791	When a vein is merely punctured, the bleeding may be arrested by
 40792	pressure with a pad of gauze, or by a lateral ligature--that is, picking
 40793	up the margins of the rent in the wall and securing them with a
 40794	ligature without occluding the lumen. In the large veins, such as the
 40795	internal jugular, the femoral, or the axillary, it is usually possible
 40796	to suture the opening in the wall. This does not necessarily result in
 40797	thrombosis in the vessel, or in obliteration of its lumen.
 40798	
 40799	When an _artery and vein are simultaneously wounded_, the features
 40800	peculiar to each are present in greater or less degree. In the limbs
 40801	gangrene may ensue, especially if the wound is infected. Punctured and
 40802	gun-shot wounds implicating both artery and vein are liable to be
 40803	followed by the development of arterio-venous aneurysm.
 40804	
 40805	#Entrance of Air into Veins--Air Embolism.#--This serious, though
 40806	fortunately rare, accident is apt to occur in the course of operations
 40807	in the region of the thorax, neck, or axilla, if a large vein is opened
 40808	and fails to collapse on account of the rigidity of its walls, its
 40809	incorporation in a dense fascia, or from traction being made upon it. If
 40810	the wound in a vein is thus held open, the negative pressure during
 40811	inspiration sucks air into the right side of the heart. This is
 40812	accompanied by a hissing or gurgling sound, and with the next expiration
 40813	some frothy blood escapes from the wound. The patient instantly becomes
 40814	pale, the pupils dilate, respiration becomes laboured, and although the
 40815	heart may continue to beat forcibly, the peripheral pulse is weak, and
 40816	may even be imperceptible. On auscultating the heart, a churning sound
 40817	may be heard. Death may result in a few minutes; or the heart may slowly
 40818	regain its power and recovery take place.
 40819	
 40820	_Prevention._--In operations in the "dangerous area"--as the region of
 40821	the root of the neck is called in this connection--care must be taken
 40822	not to cut or divide any vein before it has been secured by forceps, and
 40823	to apply ligatures securely and at once. Deep wounds in this region
 40824	should be kept filled with normal salt solution. Immediately a cut is
 40825	recognised in a vein, a finger should be placed over the vessel on the
 40826	cardiac side of the wound, and kept there until the opening is secured.
 40827	
 40828	_Treatment._--Little can be done after the air has actually entered the
 40829	vein beyond endeavouring to maintain the heart's action by hypodermic
 40830	injections of ether or strychnin and the application of mustard or hot
 40831	cloths over the chest. The head at the same time should be lowered to
 40832	prevent syncope. Attempts to withdraw the air by suction, and the
 40833	employment of artificial respiration, have proved futile, and are, by
 40834	some, considered dangerous. In a desperate case massage of the heart
 40835	might be tried.
 40836	
 40837	
 40838	THE NATURAL ARREST OF HAEMORRHAGE AND THE REPAIR OF BLOOD
 40839	VESSELS
 40840	
 40841	#Primary Haemorrhage.#--The term primary haemorrhage is applied to the
 40842	bleeding which follows immediately on the wounding of a blood vessel.
 40843	The natural process by which such haemorrhage is arrested varies with the
 40844	character of the wound in the vessel and may be modified by accidental
 40845	circumstances.
 40846	
 40847	(a) _Repair of completely divided Artery._--When an artery is
 40848	_completely_ divided, the circular fibres of the muscular coat contract,
 40849	so that the lumen of the cut ends is diminished, and at the same time
 40850	each segment retracts within its sheath in virtue of the recoil of the
 40851	elastic elements in its walls, the tunica intima curls up in the
 40852	interior of the vessel, and the tunica externa collapses over the cut
 40853	ends. The blood that escapes from the injured vessel fills the
 40854	interstices of the tissues, and, coagulating, forms a clot which
 40855	temporarily arrests the bleeding. That part of the clot which lies
 40856	between the divided ends of the vessel and in the cellular tissue
 40857	outside, is known as the _external clot_, while the portion which
 40858	projects into the lumen of the vessel is known as the _internal clot_,
 40859	and it usually extends as far as the nearest collateral branch. These
 40860	processes constitute what is known as the _temporary arrest of
 40861	haemorrhage_, which, it will be observed, is effected by the contraction
 40862	and retraction of the divided artery and by clotting.
 40863	
 40864	The _permanent arrest_ takes place by the transformation of the clot
 40865	into scar tissue. The internal clot plays the most important part in the
 40866	process; it becomes invaded by leucocytes and proliferating endothelial
 40867	and connective-tissue cells, and new blood vessels permeate the mass,
 40868	which is thus converted into granulation tissue. This is ultimately
 40869	replaced by fibrous tissue, which permanently occludes the end of the
 40870	vessel. Concurrently and by the same process the external clot is
 40871	converted into scar tissue.
 40872	
 40873	If a divided artery is _ligated at its cut end_, the tension of the
 40874	ligature is usually sufficient to rupture the inner and middle coats,
 40875	which curl up within the lumen, the outer coat alone being held in the
 40876	grasp of the ligature. An internal clot forms and, becoming organised,
 40877	permanently occludes the vessel as above described. The ligature and the
 40878	small portion of vessel beyond it are subsequently absorbed.
 40879	
 40880	In course of time the collateral branches of the vessel above and below
 40881	the level of section enlarge and their inter-communication becomes more
 40882	free, so that even when large trunks have been divided the vascular
 40883	supply of the parts beyond may be completely restored. This is known as
 40884	the development of the _collateral circulation_.
 40885	
 40886	_Imperfect Collateral Circulation._--While the development of the
 40887	collateral circulation after the ligation or obstruction from other
 40888	cause of a main arterial trunk may be sufficient to prevent gangrene of
 40889	the limb, it may be insufficient for its adequate nourishment; it may be
 40890	cold, bluish in colour, and there may be necrosis of the skin over bony
 40891	points; this is notably the case in the lower extremity after ligation
 40892	of the femoral or popliteal artery, when patches of skin may die over
 40893	the prominence of the heel, the balls of the toes, the projecting base
 40894	of the fifth metatarsal and the external malleolus.
 40895	
 40896	If, during the period of reaction, the blood-pressure rises
 40897	
 40898	considerably, the occluding clot at the divided end of the vessel may be
 40899	washed away or the ligature displaced, permitting of fresh bleeding
 40900	taking place--_reactionary_ or _intermediary haemorrhage_ (p. 272).
 40901	
 40902	In the event of the wound becoming infected with pyogenic organisms, the
 40903	occluding blood-clot or the young fibrous tissue may become
 40904	disintegrated in the suppurative process, and the bleeding start
 40905	afresh--_secondary haemorrhage_ (p. 273).
 40906	
 40907	(b) If an artery is only _partly cut across_, the divided fibres of
 40908	the tunica muscularis contract and those of the tunica externa retract,
 40909	with the result that a more or less circular hole is formed in the wall
 40910	of the vessel, from which free bleeding takes place, as the conditions
 40911	are unfavourable for the formation of an occluding clot. Even if a clot
 40912	does form, when the blood-pressure rises it is readily displaced,
 40913	leading to reactionary haemorrhage. Should the wound become infected,
 40914	secondary haemorrhage is specially liable to occur. A further risk
 40915	attends this form of injury, in that the intra-vascular tension may in
 40916	time lead to gradual stretching of the scar tissue which closes the gap
 40917	in the vessel wall, with the result that a localised dilatation or
 40918	diverticulum forms, constituting a _traumatic aneurysm_.
 40919	
 40920	(c) When the injury merely takes the form of a _puncture_ or _small
 40921	incision_ a blood-clot forms between the edges, becomes organised, and
 40922	is converted into cicatricial tissue which seals the aperture. Such
 40923	wounds may also be followed by reactionary or secondary haemorrhage, or
 40924	later by the formation of a traumatic aneurysm.
 40925	
 40926	_Conditions which influence the Natural Arrest of Haemorrhage._--The
 40927	natural arrest of bleeding is favoured by tearing or crushing of the
 40928	vessel walls, owing to the contraction and retraction of the coats and
 40929	the tendency of blood to coagulate when in contact with damaged tissue.
 40930	Hence the primary haemorrhage following lacerated wounds is seldom
 40931	copious. The occurrence of syncope or of profound shock also helps to
 40932	stop bleeding by reducing the force of the heart's action.
 40933	
 40934	On the other hand, there are conditions which retard the natural arrest.
 40935	When, for example, a vessel is only partly divided, the contraction and
 40936	retraction of the muscular coat, instead of diminishing the calibre of
 40937	the artery, causes the wound in the vessel to gape; by completing the
 40938	division of the vessel under these circumstances the bleeding can often
 40939	be arrested. In certain situations, also, the arteries are so intimately
 40940	connected with their sheaths, that when cut across they were unable to
 40941	retract and contract--for example, in the scalp, in the penis, and in
 40942	bones--and copious bleeding may take place from comparatively small
 40943	vessels. This inability of the vessels to contract and retract is met
 40944	with also in inflamed and oedematous parts and in scar tissue. Arteries
 40945	divided in the substance of a muscle also sometimes bleed unduly. Any
 40946	increase in the force of the heart's action, such as may result from
 40947	exertion, excitement, or over-stimulation, also interferes with the
 40948	natural arrest. Lastly, in bleeders, there are conditions which
 40949	interfere with the natural arrest of haemorrhage.
 40950	
 40951	#Repair of a Vessel ligated in its Continuity.#--When a ligature is
 40952	applied to an artery it should be pulled sufficiently tight to occlude
 40953	the lumen without causing rupture of its coats. It often happens,
 40954	however, that the compression causes rupture of the inner and middle
 40955	coats, so that only the outer coat remains in the grasp of the ligature.
 40956	While this weakens the wall of the vessel, it has the advantage of
 40957	hastening coagulation, by bringing the blood into contact with damaged
 40958	tissue. Whether the inner and middle coats are ruptured or not, blood
 40959	coagulates both above and below the ligature, the proximal clot being
 40960	longer and broader than that on the distal side. In small arteries these
 40961	clots extend as far as the nearest collateral branch, but in the larger
 40962	trunks their length varies. The permanent occlusion of those portions of
 40963	the vessel occupied by clot is brought about by the formation of
 40964	granulation tissue, and its replacement by cicatricial tissue, so that
 40965	the occluded segment of the vessel is represented by a fibrous cord. In
 40966	this process the coagulum only plays a passive role by forming a
 40967	scaffolding on which the granulation tissue is built up. The ligature
 40968	surrounding the vessel, and the elements of the clot, are ultimately
 40969	absorbed.
 40970	
 40971	#Repair of Veins.#--The process of repair in veins is the same as that
 40972	in arteries, but the thrombosed area may become canalised and the
 40973	circulation through the vessel be re-established.
 40974	
 40975	
 40976	HAEMORRHAGE IN SURGICAL OPERATIONS
 40977	
 40978	The management of the haemorrhage which accompanies an operation includes
 40979	(a) preventive measures, and (b) the arrest of the bleeding.
 40980	
 40981	#Prevention of Haemorrhage.#--Whenever possible, haemorrhage should be
 40982	controlled by _digital compression_ of the main artery supplying the
 40983	limb rather than by a tourniquet. If efficiently applied compression
 40984	reduces the immediate loss of blood to a minimum, and the bleeding from
 40985	small vessels that follows the removal of the tourniquet is avoided.
 40986	Further, the pressure of a tourniquet has been shown to be a material
 40987	factor in producing shock.
 40988	
 40989	In selecting a point at which to apply digital compression, it is
 40990	essential that the vessel should be lying over a bone which will furnish
 40991	the necessary resistance. The common carotid, for example, is pressed
 40992	backward and medially against the transverse process (carotid tubercle)
 40993	of the sixth cervical vertebra; the temporal against the temporal
 40994	process (zygoma) in front of the ear; and the facial against the
 40995	mandible at the anterior edge of the masseter.
 40996	
 40997	In the upper extremity, the subclavian is pressed against the first rib
 40998	by making pressure downwards and backwards in the hollow above the
 40999	clavicle; the axillary and brachial by pressing against the shaft of the
 41000	humerus.
 41001	
 41002	In the lower extremity, the femoral is controlled by pressing in a
 41003	direction backward and slightly upward against the brim of the pelvis,
 41004	midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac
 41005	spine.
 41006	
 41007	The abdominal aorta may be compressed against the bodies of the lumbar
 41008	vertebrae opposite the umbilicus, if the spine is arched well forwards
 41009	over a pillow or sand-bag, or by the method suggested by Macewen, in
 41010	which the patient's spine is arched forwards by allowing the lower
 41011	extremities and pelvis to hang over the end of the table, while the
 41012	assistant, standing on a stool, applies his closed fist over the
 41013	abdominal aorta and compresses it against the vertebral column.
 41014	Momburg recommends an elastic cord wound round the body between the
 41015	iliac crest and the lower border of the ribs, but this procedure has
 41016	caused serious damage to the intestine.
 41017	
 41018	When digital compression is not available, the most convenient and
 41019	certain means of preventing haemorrhage--say in an amputation--is by the
 41020	use of some form of _tourniquet_, such as the elastic tube of Esmarch or
 41021	of Foulis, or an elastic bandage, or the screw tourniquet of Petit.
 41022	Before applying any of these it is advisable to empty the limb of blood.
 41023	This is best done after the manner suggested by Lister: the limb is held
 41024	vertical for three or four minutes; the veins are thus emptied by
 41025	gravitation, and they collapse, and as a physiological result of this
 41026	the arteries reflexly contract, so that the quantity of blood entering
 41027	the limb is reduced to a minimum. With the limb still elevated the
 41028	tourniquet is firmly applied, a part being selected where the vessel can
 41029	be pressed directly against a bone, and where there is no risk of
 41030	exerting injurious pressure on the nerve-trunks. The tourniquet should
 41031	be applied over several layers of gauze or lint to protect the skin, and
 41032	the first turn of the tourniquet must be rapidly and tightly applied to
 41033	arrest completely the arterial flow, otherwise the veins only are
 41034	obstructed and the limb becomes congested. In the lower extremity the
 41035	best place to apply a tourniquet is the middle third of the thigh; in
 41036	the upper extremity, in the middle of the arm. A tourniquet should never
 41037	be applied tighter or left on longer than is absolutely necessary.
 41038	
 41039	The screw tourniquet of Petit is to be preferred when it is desired to
 41040	intermit the flow through the main artery as in operations for aneurysm.
 41041	
 41042	When a tourniquet cannot conveniently be applied, or when its presence
 41043	interferes with the carrying out of the operation--as, for example, in
 41044	amputations at the hip or shoulder--the haemorrhage may be controlled by
 41045	preliminary ligation of the main artery above the seat of operation--for
 41046	instance, the external iliac or the subclavian. For such contingencies
 41047	also the steel skewers used by Spence and Wyeth, or a special clamp or
 41048	forceps, such as that suggested by Lynn Thomas, may be employed. In the
 41049	case of vessels which it is undesirable to occlude permanently, such as
 41050	the common carotid, the temporary application of a ligature or clamp is
 41051	useful.
 41052	
 41053	#Arrest of Haemorrhage.#--_Ligature._--This is the best means of securing
 41054	the larger vessels. The divided vessel having been caught with forceps
 41055	as near to its cut end as possible, a ligature of catgut or silk is tied
 41056	round it. When there is difficulty in applying a ligature securely, for
 41057	example in a dense tissue like the scalp or periosteum, or in a friable
 41058	tissue like the thyreoid gland or the mesentery, a stitch should be
 41059	passed so as to surround the bleeding vessel a short distance from its
 41060	end, in this way ensuring a better hold and preventing the ligature from
 41061	slipping.
 41062	
 41063	If the haemorrhage is from a partly divided vessel, this should be
 41064	completely cut across to enable its walls to contract and retract, and
 41065	to facilitate the application of forceps and ligatures.
 41066	
 41067	_Torsion._--This method is seldom employed except for comparatively
 41068	small vessels, but it is applicable to even the largest arteries. In
 41069	employing torsion, the end of the vessel is caught with forceps, and the
 41070	terminal portion twisted round several times. The object is to tear the
 41071	inner and middle coats so that they curl up inside the lumen, while the
 41072	outer fibrous coat is twisted into a cord which occludes the end of the
 41073	vessel.
 41074	
 41075	_Forci-pressure._--Bleeding from the smallest arteries and from
 41076	arterioles can usually be arrested by firmly squeezing them for a few
 41077	minutes with artery forceps. It is usually found that on the removal of
 41078	the forceps at the end of an operation no further haemorrhage takes
 41079	place. By the use of specially strong clamps, such as the angiotribes of
 41080	Doyen, large trunks may be occluded by pressure.
 41081	
 41082	_Cautery._--The actual cautery or Paquelin's thermo-cautery is seldom
 41083	employed to arrest haemorrhage, but is frequently useful in preventing
 41084	it, as, for example, in the removal of piles, or in opening the bowel in
 41085	colostomy. It is used at a dull-red heat, which sears the divided ends
 41086	of the vessel and so occludes the lumen. A bright-red or a white heat
 41087	cuts the vessel across without occluding it. The separation of the
 41088	slough produced by the charring of the tissues is sometimes attended
 41089	with secondary bleeding.
 41090	
 41091	_Haemostatics_ or _Styptics_.--The local application of haemostatics is
 41092	seldom to be recommended. In the treatment of epistaxis or bleeding from
 41093	the nose, of haemorrhage from the socket of a tooth, and sometimes from
 41094	ulcerating or granulating surfaces, however, they may be useful. All
 41095	clots must be removed and the drug applied directly to the bleeding
 41096	surface. Adrenalin and turpentine are the most useful drugs for this
 41097	purpose.
 41098	
 41099	Haemorrhage from bone, for example the skull, may be arrested by means of
 41100	Horsley's aseptic plastic wax. To stop persistent oozing from soft
 41101	tissues, Horsley successfully applied a portion of living vascular
 41102	tissue, such as a fragment of muscle, which readily adheres to the
 41103	oozing surface and yields elements that cause coagulation of the blood
 41104	by thrombo-kinetic processes. When examined after two or three days the
 41105	muscle has been found to be closely adherent and undergoing
 41106	organisation.
 41107	
 41108	#Arrest of Accidental Haemorrhage.#--The most efficient means of
 41109	temporarily controlling haemorrhage is by pressure applied with the
 41110	finger, or with a pad of gauze, directly over the bleeding point. While
 41111	this is maintained an assistant makes digital pressure, or applies a
 41112	tourniquet, over the main vessel of the limb on the proximal side of the
 41113	bleeding point. A useful _emergency tourniquet_ may be improvised by
 41114	folding a large handkerchief _en cravatte_, with a cork or piece of wood
 41115	in the fold to act as a pad. The handkerchief is applied round the
 41116	limb, with the pad over the main artery, and the ends knotted on the
 41117	lateral aspect of the limb. With a strong piece of wood the handkerchief
 41118	is wound up like a Spanish windlass, until sufficient pressure is
 41119	exerted to arrest the bleeding.
 41120	
 41121	When haemorrhage is taking place from a number of small vessels, its
 41122	arrest may be effected by elevation of the bleeding part, particularly
 41123	if it is a limb. By this means the force of the circulation is
 41124	diminished and the formation of coagula favoured. Similarly, in wounds
 41125	of the hand or forearm, or of the foot or leg, bleeding may be arrested
 41126	by placing a pad in the flexure and acutely flexing the limb at the
 41127	elbow or knee respectively.
 41128	
 41129	#Reactionary Haemorrhage.#--Reactionary or intermediary haemorrhage
 41130	is really a recurrence of primary bleeding. As the name indicates, it
 41131	occurs during the period of reaction--that is, within the first twelve
 41132	hours after an operation or injury. It may be due to the increase in the
 41133	blood-pressure that accompanies reaction displacing clots which have
 41134	formed in the vessels, or causing vessels to bleed which did not bleed
 41135	during the operation; to the slipping of a ligature; or to the giving
 41136	way of a grossly damaged portion of the vessel wall. In the scrotum, the
 41137	relaxation of the dartos during the first few hours after operation
 41138	occasionally leads to reactionary haemorrhage.
 41139	
 41140	As a rule, reactionary haemorrhage takes place from small vessels as a
 41141	result of the displacement of occluding clots, and in many cases the
 41142	haemorrhage stops when the bandages and soaked dressings are removed. If
 41143	not, it is usually sufficient to remove the clots and apply firm
 41144	pressure, and in the case of a limb to elevate it. Should the haemorrhage
 41145	recur, the wound must be reopened, and ligatures applied to the bleeding
 41146	vessels. Douching the wound with hot sterilised water (about 110 o F.),
 41147	and plugging it tightly with gauze, are often successful in arresting
 41148	capillary oozing. When the bleeding is more copious, it is usually due
 41149	to a ligature having slipped from a large vessel such as the external
 41150	jugular vein after operations in the neck, and the wound must be opened
 41151	up and the vessel again secured. The internal administration of heroin
 41152	or morphin, by keeping the patient quiet, may prove useful in preventing
 41153	the recurrence of haemorrhage.
 41154	
 41155	#Secondary Haemorrhage.#--The term secondary haemorrhage refers to
 41156	bleeding that is delayed in its onset and is due to pyogenic infection
 41157	of the tissues around an artery. The septic process causes softening and
 41158	erosion of the wall of the artery so that it gives way under the
 41159	pressure of the contained blood. The leakage may occur in drops, or as a
 41160	rush of blood, according to the extent of the erosion, the size of the
 41161	artery concerned, and the relations of the erosion to the surrounding
 41162	tissues. When met with as a complication of a wound there is an
 41163	interval--usually a week to ten days--between the receipt of the wound
 41164	and the first haemorrhage, this time being required for the extension of
 41165	the septic process to the wall of the artery and the consequent erosion
 41166	of its coats. When secondary haemorrhage occurs apart from a wound, there
 41167	is a similar septic process attacking the wall of the artery from the
 41168	outside; for example in sloughing sore-throat, the separation of a
 41169	slough may implicate the wall of an artery and be followed by serious
 41170	and it may be fatal haemorrhage. The mechanical pressure of a fragment of
 41171	bone or of a rubber drainage tube upon the vessel may aid the septic
 41172	process in causing erosion of the artery. In pre-Listerian days, the
 41173	silk ligature around the artery likewise favoured the changes that lead
 41174	to secondary haemorrhage, and the interesting observation was often made,
 41175	that when the collateral circulation was well established, the leakage
 41176	occurred on the _distal_ side of the ligature. While it may happen that
 41177	the initial haemorrhage is rapidly fatal, as for example when the
 41178	external carotid or one of its branches suddenly gives way, it is quite
 41179	common to have one, two or more _warning haemorrhages_ before the leakage
 41180	on a large scale, which is rapidly fatal.
 41181	
 41182	The _appearances of the wound_ in cases complicated by secondary
 41183	haemorrhage are only characteristic in so far that while obviously
 41184	infected, there is an absence of all reaction; instead of frankly
 41185	suppurating, there is little or no discharge and the surrounding
 41186	cellular tissue and the limb beyond are oedematous and pit on pressure.
 41187	
 41188	The _general symptoms_ of septic poisoning in cases of secondary
 41189	haemorrhage vary widely in severity: they may be so slight that the
 41190	general health is scarcely affected and the convalescence from an
 41191	operation, for example, may be apparently normal except that the wound
 41192	does not heal satisfactorily. For example, a patient may be recovering
 41193	from an operation such as the removal of an epithelioma of the mouth,
 41194	pharynx or larynx and the associated lymph glands in the neck, and be
 41195	able to be up and going about his room, when, suddenly, without warning
 41196	and without obvious cause, a rush of blood occurs from the mouth or the
 41197	incompletely healed wound in the neck, causing death within a few
 41198	minutes.
 41199	
 41200	On the other hand, the toxaemia may be of a profound type associated with
 41201	marked pallor and progressive failure of strength, which, of itself,
 41202	even when the danger from haemorrhage has been overcome, may have a fatal
 41203	termination. The _prognosis_ therefore in cases of secondary haemorrhage
 41204	can never be other than uncertain and unfavourable; the danger from loss
 41205	of blood _per se_ is less when the artery concerned is amenable to
 41206	control by surgical measures.
 41207	
 41208	_Treatment._--The treatment of secondary haemorrhage includes the use of
 41209	local measures to arrest the bleeding, the employment of general
 41210	measures to counteract the accompanying toxaemia, and when the loss of
 41211	blood has been considerable, the treatment of the bloodless state.
 41212	
 41213	_Local Measures to arrest the Haemorrhage._--The occurrence of even
 41214	slight haemorrhages from a septic wound in the vicinity of a large blood
 41215	vessel is to be taken seriously; it is usually necessary to _open up the
 41216	wound_, clear out the clots and infected tissues with a sharp spoon,
 41217	disinfect the walls of the cavity with eusol or hydrogen peroxide, and
 41218	_pack_ it carefully but not too tightly with gauze impregnated with some
 41219	antiseptic, such as "bipp," so that, if the bleeding does not recur, it
 41220	may be left undisturbed for several days. The packing should if possible
 41221	be brought into actual contact with the leaking point in the vessel, and
 41222	so arranged as to make pressure on the artery above the erosion. The
 41223	dressings and bandage are then applied, with the limb in the attitude
 41224	that will diminish the force of the stream through the main artery, for
 41225	example, flexion at the elbow in haemorrhage from the deep palmar arch.
 41226	Other measures for combating the local sepsis, such as the irrigation
 41227	method of Carrel, may be considered.
 41228	
 41229	If the wound involves one of the extremities, it may be useful; and it
 41230	imparts confidence to the nurse, and, it may be, to the patient, if a
 41231	Petit's tourniquet is loosely applied above the wound, which the nurse
 41232	is instructed to tighten up in the event of bleeding taking place.
 41233	
 41234	_Ligation of the Artery._--If the haemorrhage recurs in spite of packing
 41235	the wound, or if it is serious from the outset and likely to be critical
 41236	if repeated, ligation of the artery itself or of the trunk from which it
 41237	springs, at a selected spot higher up, should be considered. This is
 41238	most often indicated in wounds of the extremities.
 41239	
 41240	As examples of proximal ligation for secondary haemorrhage may be cited
 41241	ligation of the hypogastric artery for haemorrhage in the buttock, of the
 41242	common iliac for haemorrhage in the thigh, of the brachial in the upper
 41243	arm for haemorrhage from the deep palmar arch, and of the posterior
 41244	tibial behind the medial malleolus for haemorrhage from the sole of the
 41245	foot.
 41246	
 41247	_Amputation_ is the last resource, and should be decided upon if the
 41248	haemorrhage recurs after proximal ligation, or if this has been followed
 41249	by gangrene of the limb; it should also be considered if the nature of
 41250	the wound and the virulence of the sepsis would of themselves justify
 41251	removal of the limb. Every surgeon can recall cases in which a timely
 41252	amputation has been the means of saving life.
 41253	
 41254	The _counteraction of the toxaemia_ and the _treatment of the bloodless
 41255	state_, are carried out on the usual lines.
 41256	
 41257	#Haemorrhage of Toxic Origin.#--Mention must also be made of haemorrhages
 41258	which depend upon infective or toxic conditions and in which no gross
 41259	lesion of the vessels can be discovered. The bleeding occurs as an
 41260	oozing, which may be comparatively slight and unimportant, or by its
 41261	persistence may become serious. It takes place into the superficial
 41262	layers of the skin, from mucous membranes, and into the substance of
 41263	such organs as the pancreas. Haemorrhage from the stomach and intestine,
 41264	attended with a brown or black discoloration of the vomit and of the
 41265	stools, is one of the best known examples: it is not uncommonly met with
 41266	in infective conditions originating in the appendix, intestine,
 41267	gall-bladder, and other abdominal organs. Haemorrhage from the mucous
 41268	membrane of the stomach after abdominal operations--apparently also due
 41269	to toxic causes and not to the operation--gives rise to the so-called
 41270	_post-operative haematemesis_.
 41271	
 41272	#Constitutional Effects of Haemorrhage.#--The severity of the symptoms
 41273	resulting from haemorrhage depends as much on the rapidity with which the
 41274	bleeding takes place as on the amount of blood lost. The sudden loss of
 41275	a large quantity, whether from an open wound or into a serous
 41276	cavity--for example, after rupture of the liver or spleen--is attended
 41277	with marked pallor of the surface of the body and coldness of the skin,
 41278	especially of the face, feet, and hands. The skin is moist with a cold,
 41279	clammy sweat, and beads of perspiration stand out on the forehead. The
 41280	pulse becomes feeble, soft, and rapid, and the patient is dull and
 41281	listless, and complains of extreme thirst. The temperature is usually
 41282	sub-normal; and the respiration rapid, shallow, and sighing in
 41283	character. Abnormal visual sensations, in the form of flashes of light
 41284	or spots before the eyes; and rushing, buzzing, or ringing sounds in the
 41285	ears, are often complained of.
 41286	
 41287	In extreme cases, phenomena which have been aptly described as those of
 41288	"air-hunger" ensue. On account of the small quantity of blood
 41289	circulating through the body, and the diminished haemoglobin content of
 41290	the blood, the tissues are imperfectly oxygenated, and the patient
 41291	becomes extremely restless, gasping for breath, constantly throwing
 41292	about his arms and baring his chest in the vain attempt to breath more
 41293	freely. Faintness and giddiness are marked features. The diminished
 41294	supply of oxygen to the brain and to the muscles produces muscular
 41295	twitchings, and sometimes convulsions. Finally the pupils dilate, the
 41296	sphincters relax, and death ensues.
 41297	
 41298	Young children stand the loss of blood badly, but they quickly recover,
 41299	as the regeneration of blood takes place rapidly. In old people also,
 41300	and especially when they are fat, the loss of blood is badly borne, and
 41301	the ill effects last longer. Women, on the whole, stand loss of blood
 41302	better than men, and in them the blood is more rapidly re-formed. A few
 41303	hours after a severe haemorrhage there is usually a leucocytosis of from
 41304	15,000 to 30,000.
 41305	
 41306	#Treatment of the Bloodless State.#--The patient should be placed in a
 41307	warm, well-ventilated room, and the foot of the bed elevated. Cardiac
 41308	stimulants, such as strychnin or alcohol, must be judiciously
 41309	administered, over-stimulation being avoided. The inhalation of oxygen
 41310	has been found useful in relieving the urgent symptoms of dyspnoea.
 41311	
 41312	The blood may be emptied from the limbs into the vessels of the trunk,
 41313	where it is more needed, by holding them vertically in the air for a few
 41314	minutes, and then applying a firm elastic bandage over a layer of cotton
 41315	wool, from the periphery towards the trunk.
 41316	
 41317	_Introduction of Fluids into the Circulation._--The most valuable
 41318	measure for maintaining the circulation, however, is by transfusion of
 41319	blood (_Op. Surg._, p. 37). If this is not immediately available the
 41320	introduction of from one to three pints of physiological salt
 41321	solution (a teaspoonful of common salt to a pint of water) into a vein,
 41322	or a 6 per cent. solution of gum acacia, is a useful expedient. The
 41323	solution is sterilised by boiling, and cooled to a temperature of about
 41324	105 o F. The addition of 5 to 10 minims of adrenalin solution (1 in 1000)
 41325	is advantageous in raising the blood-pressure (_Op. Surg._, p. 565).
 41326	
 41327	When the intra-venous method is not available, one or two pints of
 41328	saline solution with adrenalin should be slowly introduced into the
 41329	rectum, by means of a long rubber tube and a filler. Satisfactory,
 41330	although less rapidly obtained results follow the introduction of saline
 41331	solution into the cellular tissue--for example, under the mamma, into
 41332	the axilla, or under the skin of the back.
 41333	
 41334	If the patient can retain fluids taken by the mouth--such as hot coffee,
 41335	barley water, or soda water--these should be freely given, unless the
 41336	injury necessitates operative treatment under a general anaesthetic.
 41337	
 41338	Transfusion of blood is most valuable as _a preliminary to operation_ in
 41339	patients who are bloodless as a result of haemorrhage from gastric and
 41340	duodenal ulcers, and in bleeders.
 41341	
 41342	
 41343	HAEMOPHILIA
 41344	
 41345	The term haemophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the
 41346	patient liable to serious haemorrhage from even the most trivial
 41347	injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as "bleeders."
 41348	
 41349	The cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown. There
 41350	is no proof of any structural defect in the blood vessels, and beyond
 41351	the fact that there is a diminution in the number of blood-plates, it
 41352	has not been demonstrated that there is any alteration in the
 41353	composition of the blood.
 41354	
 41355	The affection is in a marked degree hereditary, all the branches of an
 41356	affected family being liable to suffer. Its mode of transmission to
 41357	individuals, moreover, is characteristic: the male members of the stock
 41358	alone suffer from the affection in its typical form, while the tendency
 41359	is transmitted through the female line. Thus the daughters of a father
 41360	who is a bleeder, whilst they do not themselves suffer from the disease,
 41361	transmit the tendency to their male offspring. The sons, on the other
 41362	hand, neither suffer themselves nor transmit the disease to their
 41363	children (Fig. 64). The female members of a haemophilic stock are often
 41364	very prolific, and there is usually a predominance of daughters in their
 41365	families.

 41419	 ** the patients observed by the authors. The dotted line shows the
 41420	    transmission of the disease to our patients through four
 41421	    generations.
 41422	
 41423	
 41424	The disease is met with in boys who are otherwise healthy, and usually
 41425	manifests itself during the first few years of life. In rare instances
 41426	profuse haemorrhage takes place when the umbilical cord separates. As a
 41427	rule the first evidence is the occurrence of long-continued and
 41428	uncontrollable bleeding from a comparatively slight injury, such as the
 41429	scratch of a pin, the extraction of a tooth, or after the operation of
 41430	circumcision. The blood oozes slowly from the capillaries; at first it
 41431	appears normal, but after flowing for some days, or it may be weeks, it
 41432	becomes pale, thin, and watery, and shows less and less tendency to
 41433	coagulate.
 41434	
 41435	Female members of haemophilia families sometimes show a tendency to
 41436	excessive haemorrhage, but they seldom manifest the characteristic
 41437	features met with in the male members.
 41438	
 41439	Sometimes the haemorrhage takes place apparently spontaneously from the
 41440	gums, the nasal or the intestinal mucous membrane. In other cases the
 41441	bleeding occurs into the cellular tissue under the skin or mucous
 41442	membrane, producing large areas of ecchymosis and discoloration. One of
 41443	the commonest manifestations of the disease is the occurrence of
 41444	haemorrhage into the cavities of the large joints, especially the knee,
 41445	elbow, or hip. The patient suffers repeatedly from such haemorrhages, the
 41446	determining injury being often so slight as to have passed unobserved.
 41447	
 41448	There is evidence that the tendency to bleed is greater at certain times
 41449	than at others--in some cases showing almost a cyclical
 41450	character--although nothing is known as to the cause of the variation.
 41451	
 41452	After a severe haemorrhage into the cellular tissue or into a joint, the
 41453	patient becomes pale and anaemic, the temperature may rise to 102 o or
 41454	103 o F., the pulse become small and rapid, and haemic murmurs are
 41455	sometimes developed over the heart and large arteries. The swelling is
 41456	tense, fluctuating, and hot, and there is considerable pain and
 41457	tenderness.
 41458	
 41459	In exceptional cases, blisters form over the seat of the effusion, or
 41460	the skin may even slough, and the clinical features may therefore come
 41461	to simulate closely those of an acute suppurative condition. When the
 41462	skin sloughs, an ulcer is formed with altered blood-clot in its floor
 41463	like that seen in scurvy, and there is a remarkable absence of any
 41464	attempt at healing.
 41465	
 41466	The acute symptoms gradually subside, and the blood is slowly absorbed,
 41467	the discoloration of the skin passing through the same series of changes
 41468	as occur after an ordinary bruise. The patients seldom manifest the
 41469	symptoms of the bloodless state, and the blood is rapidly regenerated.
 41470	
 41471	The _diagnosis_ is easy if the patient or his friends are aware of the
 41472	family tendency to haemorrhage and inform the doctor of it, but they are
 41473	often sensitive and reticent regarding the fact, and it may only be
 41474	elicited after close investigation. From the history it is usually easy
 41475	to exclude scurvy and purpura. Repeated haemorrhages into a joint may
 41476	result in appearances which closely simulate those of tuberculous
 41477	disease. Recent haemorrhages into the cellular tissue often present
 41478	clinical features closely resembling those of acute cellulitis or
 41479	osteomyelitis. A careful examination, however, may reveal ecchymoses on
 41480	other parts of the body which give a clue to the nature of the
 41481	condition, and may prevent the disastrous consequences that may follow
 41482	incision.
 41483	
 41484	These patients usually succumb sooner or later to haemorrhage, although
 41485	they often survive several severe attacks. After middle life the
 41486	tendency to bleed appears to diminish.
 41487	
 41488	_Treatment._--As a rule the ordinary means of arresting haemorrhage are
 41489	of little avail. From among the numerous means suggested, the following
 41490	may be mentioned: The application to the bleeding point of gauze soaked
 41491	in a 1 in 1000 solution of adrenalin; prolonged inhalation of oxygen;
 41492	freezing the part with a spray of ethyl-chloride; one or more
 41493	subcutaneous injections of gelatin--5 ounces of a 2 1/2 per cent.
 41494	solution of white gelatin in normal salt solution being injected at a
 41495	temperature of about 100 o F.; the injection of pituitary extract. The
 41496	application of a pad of gauze soaked in the blood of a normal person
 41497	sometimes arrests the bleeding.
 41498	
 41499	To prevent bleeding in haemophilics, intra-venous or subcutaneous
 41500	injections of fresh blood serum, taken from the human subject, the
 41501	sheep, the dog, or the horse, have proved useful. If fresh serum is not
 41502	available, anti-diphtheritic or anti-tetanic serum or trade
 41503	preparations, such as hemoplastin, may be employed. We have removed the
 41504	appendix and amputated through the thigh in haemophilic subjects without
 41505	excessive loss of blood after a course of fresh sheep's serum given by
 41506	the mouth over a period of several weeks.
 41507	
 41508	The chloride and lactate of calcium, and extract of thymus gland have
 41509	been employed to increase the coagulability of the blood. The patient
 41510	should drink large quantities of milk, which also increases the
 41511	coagulability of the blood. Monro has observed remarkable results from
 41512	the hypodermic injection of emetin hydrochloride in  1/2-grain doses.
 41513	
 41514	
 41515	THROMBOSIS AND EMBOLISM
 41516	
 41517	The processes known as thrombosis and embolism are so intimately
 41518	associated with the diseases of blood vessels that it is convenient to
 41519	define these terms in the first instance.
 41520	
 41521	#Thrombosis.#--The term _thrombus_ is applied to a clot of blood formed
 41522	in the interior of the heart or of a blood vessel, and the process by
 41523	which such a clot forms is known as _thrombosis_. It would appear that
 41524	slowing or stagnation of the blood-stream, and interference with the
 41525	integrity of the lining membrane of the vessel wall, are the most
 41526	important factors determining the formation of the clot. Alterations in
 41527	the blood itself, such as occur, for example, in certain toxaemias, also
 41528	favour coagulation. When the thrombus is formed slowly, it consists of
 41529	white blood cells with a small proportion of fibrin, and, being
 41530	deposited in successive layers, has a distinctly laminated appearance on
 41531	section. It is known as a _white thrombus_ or laminated clot, and is
 41532	often met with in the sac of an aneurysm (Fig. 72). When rapidly formed
 41533	in a vessel in which the blood is almost stagnant--as, for example, in a
 41534	pouched varicose vein--the blood coagulates _en masse_, and the clot
 41535	consists of all the elements of the blood, constituting a _red thrombus_
 41536	(Fig. 66). Sometimes the thrombus is _mixed_--a red thrombus being
 41537	deposited on a white one, it may be in alternate layers.
 41538	
 41539	When aseptic, a thrombus may become detached and be carried off in the
 41540	blood-stream as an embolus; it may become organised; or it may
 41541	degenerate and undergo calcification. Occasionally a small thrombus
 41542	situated behind a valve in a varicose vein or in the terminal end of a
 41543	dilated vein--for example in a pile--undergoes calcification, and is
 41544	then spoken of as a _phlebolith_; it gives a shadow with the X-rays.
 41545	
 41546	When infected with pyogenic bacteria, the thrombus becomes converted
 41547	into pus and a localised abscess forms; or portions of the thrombus may
 41548	be carried as emboli in the circulation to distant parts, where they
 41549	give rise to secondary foci of suppuration--pyaemic abscesses.
 41550	
 41551	#Embolism.#--The term _embolus_ is applied to any body carried along in
 41552	the circulation and ultimately becoming impacted in a blood vessel. This
 41553	occurrence is known as _embolism_. The commonest forms of embolus are
 41554	portions of thrombi or of fibrinous formations on the valves of the
 41555	heart, the latter being usually infected with micro-organisms.
 41556	
 41557	Embolism plays an important part in determining one form of gangrene, as
 41558	has already been described. Infective emboli are the direct cause of the
 41559	secondary abscesses that occur in pyaemia; and they are sometimes
 41560	responsible for the formation of aneurysm.
 41561	
 41562	Portions of malignant tumours also may form emboli, and their impaction
 41563	in the vessels may lead to the development of secondary growths in
 41564	distant parts of the body.
 41565	
 41566	Fat and air embolism have already been referred to.
 41567	
 41568	
 41569	ARTERITIS
 41570	
 41571	_Pyogenic._--Non-suppurative inflammation of the coats of an artery may
 41572	so soften the wall of the vessel as to lead to aneurysmal dilatation. It
 41573	is not uncommon in children, and explains the occurrence of aneurysm in
 41574	young subjects.
 41575	
 41576	When suppuration occurs, the vessel wall becomes disintegrated and gives
 41577	way, leading to secondary haemorrhage. If the vessel ruptures into an
 41578	abscess cavity, dangerous bleeding may occur when the abscess bursts or
 41579	is opened.
 41580	
 41581	_Syphilitic._--The inflammation associated with syphilis results in
 41582	thickening of the tunica intima, whereby the lumen of the vessel becomes
 41583	narrowed, or even obliterated--_endarteritis obliterans_. The middle
 41584	coat usually escapes, but the tunica externa is generally thickened.
 41585	These changes cause serious interference with the nutrition of the parts
 41586	supplied by the affected arteries. In large trunks, by diminishing the
 41587	elasticity of the vessel wall, they are liable to lead to the formation
 41588	of aneurysm.
 41589	
 41590	Changes in the arterial walls closely resembling those of syphilitic
 41591	arteritis are sometimes met with in _tuberculous_ lesions.
 41592	
 41593	#Arterio-sclerosis# or #Chronic Arteritis#.--These terms are applied to
 41594	certain changes which result in narrowing of the lumen and loss of
 41595	elasticity in the arteries. The condition may affect the whole vascular
 41596	system or may be confined to particular areas. In the smaller arteries
 41597	there is more or less uniform thickening of the tunica intima from
 41598	proliferation of the endothelium and increase in the connective tissue
 41599	in the elastic lamina--a form of obliterative endarteritis. The
 41600	narrowing of the vessels may be sufficient to determine gangrene in the
 41601	extremities. In course of time, particularly in the larger arteries,
 41602	this new tissue undergoes degeneration, at first of a fatty nature, but
 41603	progressing in the direction of calcification, and this is followed by
 41604	the deposit of lime salts in the young connective tissue and the
 41605	formation of calcareous plates or rings over a considerable area of the
 41606	vessel wall. To this stage in the process the term _atheroma_ is
 41607	applied. The endothelium over these plates often disappears, leaving
 41608	them exposed to the blood-stream.
 41609	
 41610	Changes of a similar kind sometimes occur in the middle coat, the lime
 41611	salts being deposited among the muscle fibres in concentric rings.
 41612	
 41613	The primary cause of arterio-sclerosis is not definitely known, but its
 41614	almost constant occurrence, to a greater or less degree, in the aged
 41615	suggests that it is of the nature of a senile degeneration. It is
 41616	favoured by anything which throws excessive strain on the vessel walls,
 41617	such as heavy muscular work; by chronic alcoholism and syphilis; or by
 41618	such general diseases as tend to raise the blood-pressure--for example,
 41619	chronic Bright's disease or gout. It occurs with greater frequency and
 41620	with greater severity in men than in women.
 41621	
 41622	Atheromatous degeneration is most common in the large arterial trunks,
 41623	and the changes are most marked at the arch of the aorta, opposite the
 41624	flexures of joints, at the mouths of large branches, and at parts where
 41625	the vessel lies in contact with bone. The presence of diseased patches
 41626	in the wall of an artery diminishes its elasticity and favours
 41627	aneurysmal dilatation. Such a vessel also is liable to be ruptured by
 41628	external violence and so give rise to traumatic aneurysm. Thrombosis is
 41629	liable to occur when calcareous plates are exposed in the lumen of the
 41630	vessel by destruction of the endothelium, and this predisposes to
 41631	embolism. Arterio-sclerosis also interferes with the natural arrest of
 41632	haemorrhage, and by rendering the vessels brittle, makes it difficult to
 41633	secure them by ligature. In advanced cases the accessible arteries--such
 41634	as the radial, the temporal or the femoral--may be felt as firm,
 41635	tortuous cords, which are sometimes so hard that they have been aptly
 41636	compared to "pipe-stems." The pulse is smaller and less compressible
 41637	than normal, and the vessel moves bodily with each pulsation. It must be
 41638	borne in mind, however, that the condition of the radial artery may fail
 41639	to afford a clue to that of the larger arteries. Calcified arteries are
 41640	readily identified in skiagrams (Fig. 65).
 41641	
 41642	[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Radiogram showing Calcareous Degeneration
 41643	(Atheroma) of Arteries.]
 41644	
 41645	We have met with a chronic form of arterial degeneration in elderly
 41646	women, affecting especially the great vessels at the root of the neck,
 41647	in which the artery is remarkably attenuated and dilated, and so friable
 41648	that the wall readily tears when seized with an artery-forceps,
 41649	rendering ligation of the vessel in the ordinary way well-nigh
 41650	impossible. Matas suggests infolding the wall of the vessel with
 41651	interrupted sutures that do not pierce the intima, and wrapping it
 41652	round with a strip of peritoneum or omentum.
 41653	
 41654	The most serious form of arterial _thrombosis_ is that met with _in the
 41655	abdominal aorta_, which is attended with violent pains in the lower
 41656	limbs, rapidly followed by paralysis and arrest of the circulation.
 41657	
 41658	
 41659	THROMBO-PHLEBITIS AND THROMBOSIS IN VEINS
 41660	
 41661	#Thrombosis# is more common in veins than in arteries, because slowing
 41662	of the blood-stream and irritation of the endothelium of the vessel wall
 41663	are, owing to the conditions of the venous circulation, more readily
 41664	induced in veins.
 41665	
 41666	Venous thrombosis may occur from purely mechanical causes--as, for
 41667	example, when the wall of a vein is incised, or the vessel included in a
 41668	ligature, or when it is bruised or crushed by a fragment of a broken
 41669	bone or by a bandage too tightly applied. Under these conditions
 41670	thrombosis is essentially a reparative process, and has already been
 41671	considered in relation to the repair of blood vessels.
 41672	
 41673	In other cases thrombosis is associated with certain constitutional
 41674	diseases--gout, for example; the endothelium of the veins undergoing
 41675	changes--possibly the result of irritation by abnormal constituents in
 41676	the blood--which favour the formation of thrombi.
 41677	
 41678	Under these various conditions the formation of a thrombus is not
 41679	necessarily associated with the action of bacteria, although in any
 41680	of them this additional factor may be present.
 41681	
 41682	The most common cause of venous thrombosis, however, is inflammation of
 41683	the wall of the vein--phlebitis.
 41684	
 41685	#Phlebitis.#--Various forms of phlebitis are met with, but for practical
 41686	purposes they may be divided into two groups--one in which there is a
 41687	tendency to the formation of a thrombus; the other in which the
 41688	infective element predominates.
 41689	
 41690	In surgical patients, the _thrombotic form_ is almost invariably met
 41691	with in the lower extremity, and usually occurs in those who are
 41692	debilitated and anaemic, and who are confined to bed for prolonged
 41693	periods--for example, during the treatment of fractures of the leg or
 41694	pelvis, or after such operations as herniotomy, prostatectomy, or
 41695	appendectomy.
 41696	
 41697	_Clinical Features._--The most typical example of this form of phlebitis
 41698	is that so frequently met with in the great saphena vein, especially
 41699	when it is varicose. The onset of the attack is indicated by a sudden
 41700	pain in the lower limb--sometimes below, sometimes above the knee. This
 41701	initial pain may be associated with shivering or even with a rigor, and
 41702	the temperature usually rises one or two degrees. There is swelling and
 41703	tenderness along the line of the affected vein, and the skin over it is
 41704	a dull-red or purple colour. The swollen vein may be felt as a firm
 41705	cord, with bead-like enlargements in the position of the valves. The
 41706	patient experiences a feeling of stiffness and tightness throughout the
 41707	limb. There is often oedema of the leg and foot, especially when the limb
 41708	is in the dependent position. The acute symptoms pass off in a few days,
 41709	but the swelling and tenderness of the vein and the oedema of the limb
 41710	may last for many weeks.
 41711	
 41712	When the deep veins--iliac, femoral, popliteal--are involved, there is
 41713	great swelling of the whole limb, which is of a firm almost "wooden"
 41714	consistence, and of a pale-white colour; the oedema may be so great that
 41715	it is impossible to feel the affected vein until the swelling has
 41716	subsided. This is most often seen in puerperal women, and is known as
 41717	_phlegmasia alba dolens_.
 41718	
 41719	_Treatment._--The patient must be placed at absolute rest, with the foot
 41720	of the bed raised on blocks 10 or 12 inches high, and the limb
 41721	immobilised by sand-bags or splints. It is necessary to avoid handling
 41722	the parts, lest the clot be displaced and embolism occur. To avoid
 41723	frequent movement of the limb, the necessary dressings should be kept in
 41724	position by means of a many-tailed rather than a roller bandage.
 41725	
 41726	To relieve the pain, warm fomentations or lead and opium lotion should
 41727	be applied. Later, ichthyol-glycerin, or glycerin and belladonna, may be
 41728	substituted.
 41729	
 41730	When, at the end of three weeks, the danger of embolism is past,
 41731	douching and gentle massage may be employed to disperse the oedema; and
 41732	when the patient gets up he should wear a supporting elastic bandage.
 41733	
 41734	The _infective_ form usually begins as a peri-phlebitis arising in
 41735	connection with some focus of infection in the adjacent tissues. The
 41736	elements of the vessel wall are destroyed by suppuration, and the
 41737	thrombus in its lumen becomes infected with pyogenic bacteria and
 41738	undergoes softening.
 41739	
 41740	_Occlusion of the inferior vena cava_ as a result of infective
 41741	thrombosis is a well-known condition, the thrombosis extending into the
 41742	main trunk from some of its tributaries, either from the femoral or
 41743	iliac veins below or from the hepatic veins above.
 41744	
 41745	Portions of the softened thrombus are liable to become detached and to
 41746	enter the circulating blood, in which they are carried as emboli. These
 41747	may lodge in distant parts, and give rise to secondary foci of
 41748	suppuration--pyaemic abscesses.
 41749	
 41750	_Clinical Features._--Infective phlebitis is most frequently met with in
 41751	the transverse sinus as a sequel to chronic suppuration in the mastoid
 41752	antrum and middle ear. It also occurs in relation to the peripheral
 41753	veins, but in these it can seldom be recognised as a separate entity,
 41754	being merged in the general infective process from which it takes
 41755	origin. Its occurrence may be inferred, if in the course of a
 41756	suppurative lesion there is a sudden rise of temperature, with pain,
 41757	redness, and swelling along the line of a venous trunk, and a rapidly
 41758	developed oedema of the limb, with pitting of the skin on pressure. In
 41759	rare cases a localised abscess forms in the vein and points towards the
 41760	surface.
 41761	
 41762	_Treatment._--Attention must be directed towards the condition with
 41763	which the phlebitis is associated. Ligation of the vein on the cardiac
 41764	side of the thrombus with a view to preventing embolism is seldom
 41765	feasible in the peripheral veins, although, as will be pointed out
 41766	later, the jugular vein is ligated with this object in cases of
 41767	phlebitis of the transverse sinus.
 41768	
 41769	
 41770	VARIX--VARICOSE VEINS
 41771	
 41772	The term varix is applied to a condition in which veins are so altered
 41773	in structure that they remain permanently dilated, and are at the same
 41774	time lengthened and tortuous. Two types are met with: one in which
 41775	dilatation of a large superficial vein and its tributaries is the most
 41776	obvious feature; the other, in which bunches of distended and tortuous
 41777	vessels develop at one or more points in the course of a vein, a
 41778	condition to which Virchow applied the term _angioma racemosum venosum_.
 41779	The two types may occur in combination.
 41780	
 41781	Any vein in the body may become varicose, but the condition is rare
 41782	except in the veins of the lower extremity, in the veins of the
 41783	spermatic cord (varicocele), and in the veins of the anal canal
 41784	(haemorrhoids).
 41785	
 41786	We are here concerned with varix as it occurs in the veins of the lower
 41787	extremity.
 41788	
 41789	_Etiology._--Considerable difference of opinion exists as to the
 41790	essential cause of varix. The weight of evidence is in favour of the
 41791	view that, when dilatation is the predominant element, it results from a
 41792	congenital deficiency in the number, size, and strength of the valves of
 41793	the affected veins, and in an inherent weakness in the vessel walls.
 41794	The _angioma racemosum venosum_ is probably also due to a congenital
 41795	alteration in the structure of the vessels, and is allied to tumours of
 41796	blood vessels. The view that varix is congenital in origin, as was first
 41797	suggested by Virchow, is supported by the fact that in a large
 41798	proportion of cases the condition is hereditary; not only may several
 41799	members of the same family in succeeding generations suffer from varix,
 41800	but it is often found that the same vein, or segment of a vein, is
 41801	involved in all of them. The frequent occurrence of varix in youth is
 41802	also an indication of its congenital origin.
 41803	
 41804	In the majority of cases it is only when some exciting factor comes into
 41805	operation that the clinical phenomena associated with varix appear. The
 41806	most common exciting cause is increased pressure within the veins, and
 41807	this may be produced in a variety of ways. In certain diseases of the
 41808	heart, lungs, and liver, for example, the venous pressure may be so
 41809	raised as to cause a localised dilatation of such veins as are
 41810	congenitally weak. The direct pressure of a tumour, or of the gravid
 41811	uterus on the large venous trunks in the pelvis, may so obstruct the
 41812	flow as to distend the veins of the lower extremity. It is a common
 41813	experience in women that the signs of varix date from an antecedent
 41814	pregnancy. The importance of the wearing of tight garters as a factor in
 41815	the production of varicose veins has been exaggerated, although it must
 41816	be admitted that this practice is calculated to aggravate the condition
 41817	when it is once established. It has been proved experimentally that the
 41818	backward pressure in the veins may be greatly increased by straining, a
 41819	fact which helps to explain the frequency with which varicosity occurs
 41820	in the lower limbs of athletes and of those whose occupation involves
 41821	repeated and violent muscular efforts. There is reason to believe,
 41822	moreover, that a sudden strain may, by rupturing the valves and so
 41823	rendering them incompetent, induce varicosity independently of any
 41824	congenital defect. Prolonged standing or walking, by allowing gravity to
 41825	act on the column of blood in the veins of the lower limbs, is also an
 41826	important determining factor in the production of varix.
 41827	
 41828	Thrombosis of the deep veins--in the leg, for example--may induce marked
 41829	dilatation of the superficial veins, by throwing an increased amount of
 41830	work upon them. This is to be looked upon rather as a compensatory
 41831	hypertrophy of the superficial vessels than as a true varix.
 41832	
 41833	_Morbid Anatomy._--In the lower extremity the varicosity most commonly
 41834	affects the vessels of the great saphena system; less frequently those
 41835	of the small saphena system. Sometimes both systems are involved, and
 41836	large communicating branches may develop between the two.
 41837	
 41838	The essential lesion is the absence or deficiency of valves, so that
 41839	they are incompetent and fail to support the column of blood which bears
 41840	back upon them. Normally the valves in the femoral and iliac veins and
 41841	in the inferior vena cava are imperfectly developed, so that in the
 41842	erect posture the great saphena receives a large share of the backward
 41843	pressure of the column of venous blood.
 41844	
 41845	The whole length of the vein may be affected, but as a rule the disease
 41846	is confined to one or more segments, which are not only dilated, but are
 41847	also increased in length, so that they become convoluted. The adjacent
 41848	loops of the convoluted vein are often bound together by fibrous tissue.
 41849	All the coats are thickened, chiefly by an increased development of
 41850	connective tissue, and in some cases changes similar to those of
 41851	arterio-sclerosis occur. The walls of varicose veins are often
 41852	exceedingly brittle. In some cases the thickening is uniform, and in
 41853	others it is irregular, so that here and there thin-walled sacs or
 41854	pouches project from the side of the vein. These pouches vary in size
 41855	from a bean to a hen's egg, the larger forms being called _venous
 41856	cysts_, and being most commonly met with in the region of the saphenous
 41857	opening and of the opening in the popliteal fascia. Such pouches, being
 41858	exposed to injury, are frequently the seat of thrombosis (Fig. 66).
 41859	
 41860	[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Thrombosis in Tortuous and Pouched Great
 41861	Saphena Vein, in longitudinal section.]
 41862	
 41863	_Clinical Features._--Varix is most frequently met with between puberty
 41864	and the age of thirty, and the sexes appear to suffer about equally.
 41865	
 41866	The amount of discomfort bears no direct proportion to the extent of
 41867	the varicosity. It depends rather upon the degree of pressure in the
 41868	veins, as is shown by the fact that it is relieved by elevation of the
 41869	limb. When the whole length of the main trunk of the great saphena is
 41870	implicated, the pressure in the vein is high and the patient suffers a
 41871	good deal of pain and discomfort. When, on the contrary, the upper part
 41872	of the saphena and its valves are intact, and only the more distal veins
 41873	are involved, the pressure is not so high and there is comparatively
 41874	little suffering. The usual complaint is of a sense of weight and
 41875	fulness in the limb after standing or walking, sometimes accompanied by
 41876	actual pain, from which relief is at once obtained by raising the limb.
 41877	Cramp-like pains in the muscles are often associated with varix of the
 41878	deep veins.
 41879	
 41880	The dilated and tortuous vein can be readily seen and felt when the
 41881	patient is examined in the upright posture. In advanced cases, bead-like
 41882	swellings are sometimes to be detected over the position of the valves,
 41883	and, on running the fingers along the course of the vessel, a firm
 41884	ridge, due to periphlebitis, may be detected on each side of the vein.
 41885	When the limb is oedematous, the outline of the veins is obscured, but
 41886	they can be identified on palpation as gutter-like tracks. When large
 41887	veins are implicated, a distinct impulse on coughing may be seen to pass
 41888	down as far as the knee; and if the vessel is sharply percussed a fluid
 41889	wave may be detected passing both up and down the vein.
 41890	
 41891	If the patient is placed on a couch and the limb elevated, the veins are
 41892	emptied, and if pressure is then made over the region of the saphenous
 41893	opening and the patient allowed to stand up, so long as the great
 41894	saphena system alone is involved, the veins fill again very slowly from
 41895	below. If the small saphena system also is involved, and if
 41896	communicating branches are dilated, the veins fill up from below more
 41897	rapidly. When the pressure over the saphenous opening is removed, the
 41898	blood rapidly rushes into the varicose vessels from above; this is known
 41899	as Trendelenburg's test.
 41900	
 41901	The most marked dilatation usually occurs on the medial side of the
 41902	limb, between the middle of the thigh and the middle of the calf, the
 41903	arrangement of the veins showing great variety (Fig. 67).
 41904	
 41905	There are usually one or more bunches of enlarged and tortuous veins in
 41906	the region of the knee. Frequently a large branch establishes a
 41907	communication between the systems of the great and small saphenous veins
 41908	in the region of the popliteal space, or across the front of the upper
 41909	part of the tibia. The superficial position of this last branch and its
 41910	proximity to the bone render it liable to injury.
 41911	
 41912	[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Extensive Varix of Internal Saphena System on
 41913	Left Leg, of many years' standing.]
 41914	
 41915	The small veins of the skin of the ankle and foot often show as fine
 41916	blue streaks arranged in a stellate or arborescent manner, especially in
 41917	women who have borne children.
 41918	
 41919	_Complications._--When the varix is of long standing, the skin in the
 41920	lower part of the leg sometimes assumes a mahogany-brown or bluish hue,
 41921	as a result of the _deposit of blood pigment_ in the tissues, and this
 41922	is frequently a precursor of ulceration.
 41923	
 41924	_Chronic dermatitis_ (_varicose eczema_) is often met with in the lower
 41925	part of the leg, and is due to interference with the nutrition of the
 41926	skin. The incompetence of the valves allows the pressure in the varicose
 41927	veins to equal that in the arterioles, so that the capillary circulation
 41928	is impeded. From the same cause the blood in the deep veins is enabled
 41929	to enter the superficial veins, where the backward pressure is so great
 41930	that the blood flows down again, and so a vicious circle is established.
 41931	The blood therefore loses more and more of its oxygen, and so fails to
 41932	nourish the tissues.
 41933	
 41934	The _ulcer_ of the leg associated with varicose veins has already been
 41935	described.
 41936	
 41937	_Haemorrhage_ may take place from a varicose vein as a result of a wound
 41938	or of ulceration of its wall. Increased intra-venous pressure produced
 41939	by severe muscular strain may determine rupture of a vein exposed in the
 41940	floor of an ulcer. If the limb is dependent, the incompetency of the
 41941	valves permits of rapid and copious bleeding, which may prove fatal,
 41942	particularly if the patient is intoxicated when the rupture takes place
 41943	and no means are taken to arrest the haemorrhage. The bleeding may be
 41944	arrested at once by elevating the limb, or by applying pressure directly
 41945	over the bleeding point.
 41946	
 41947	_Phlebitis and thrombosis_ are common sequelae of varix, and may prove
 41948	dangerous, either by spreading into the large venous trunks or by giving
 41949	rise to emboli. The larger the varix the greater is the tendency for a
 41950	thrombus to spread upwards and to involve the deep veins. Thrombi
 41951	usually originate in venous cysts or pouches, and at acute bends on the
 41952	vessel, especially when these are situated in the vicinity of the knee,
 41953	and are subjected to repeated injuries--for example in riding.
 41954	Phleboliths sometimes form in such pouches, and may be recognised in a
 41955	radiogram. In a certain proportion of cases, especially in elderly
 41956	people, the occurrence of thrombosis leads to cure of the condition by
 41957	the thrombus becoming organised and obliterating the vein.
 41958	
 41959	_Treatment._--At best the treatment of varicose veins is only
 41960	palliative, as it is obviously impossible to restore to the vessels
 41961	their normal structure. The patient must avoid wearing anything, such as
 41962	a garter, which constricts the limb, and any obvious cause of direct
 41963	pressure on the pelvic veins, such as a tumour, persistent
 41964	constipation, or an ill-fitting truss, should be removed. Cardiac,
 41965	renal, or pulmonary causes of venous congestion must also be treated,
 41966	and the functions of the liver regulated. Severe forms of muscular
 41967	exertion and prolonged standing or walking are to be avoided, and the
 41968	patient may with benefit rest the limb in an elevated position for a few
 41969	hours each day. To support the distended vessels, a closely woven silk
 41970	or worsted stocking, or a light and porous form of elastic bandage,
 41971	applied as a puttee, should be worn. These appliances should be put on
 41972	before the patient leaves his bed in the morning, and should only be
 41973	removed after he lies down at night. In this way the vessels are never
 41974	allowed to become dilated. Elastic stockings, and bandages made entirely
 41975	of india-rubber, are to be avoided. In early and mild cases these
 41976	measures are usually sufficient to relieve the patient's discomfort.
 41977	
 41978	_Operative Treatment._--In aggravated cases, when the patient is
 41979	suffering pain, when his occupation is interfered with by repeated
 41980	attacks of phlebitis, or when there are large pouches on the veins,
 41981	operative treatment is called for. The younger the patient the clearer
 41982	is the indication to operate. It may be necessary to operate to enable a
 41983	patient to enter one of the public services, even although no symptoms
 41984	are present. The presence of an ulcer does not contra-indicate
 41985	operation; the ulcer should be excised, and the raw surface covered with
 41986	skin grafts, before dealing with the veins.
 41987	
 41988	The _operation of Trendelenburg_ is especially appropriate to cases in
 41989	which the trunk of the great saphena vein in the thigh is alone
 41990	involved. It consists in exposing three or four inches of the vein in
 41991	its upper part, applying a ligature at the upper and lower ends of the
 41992	exposed portion, and, after tying all tributary branches, resecting this
 41993	portion of the vein.
 41994	
 41995	The procedure of C. H. Mayo is adapted to cases in which it is desirable
 41996	to remove longer segments of the veins. It consists in the employment of
 41997	special instruments known as "ring-enucleators" or "vein-strippers," by
 41998	means of which long portions of the vein are removed through
 41999	comparatively small incisions.
 42000	
 42001	An alternative procedure consists in avulsing segments of the vein by
 42002	means of Babcock's stylet, which consists of a flexible steel rod, 30
 42003	inches in length, with acorn-shaped terminals. The instrument is passed
 42004	along the lumen of the segment to be dealt with, and a ligature applied
 42005	around the vein above the bulbous end of the stylet enables nearly the
 42006	whole length of the great saphena vein to be dragged out in one piece.
 42007	These methods are not suitable when the veins are brittle, when there
 42008	are pouches or calcareous deposits in their walls, or where there has
 42009	been periphlebitis binding the coils together.
 42010	
 42011	Mitchell of Belfast advises exposing the varices at numerous points by
 42012	half-inch incisions, and, after clamping the vein between two pairs of
 42013	forceps, cutting it across and twisting out the segments of the vein
 42014	between adjacent incisions. The edges of the incisions are sutured; and
 42015	the limb is firmly bandaged from below upwards, and kept in an elevated
 42016	position. We have employed this method with satisfactory results.
 42017	
 42018	The treatment of the complications of varix has already been considered.
 42019	
 42020	
 42021	ANGIOMA[4]
 42022	
 42023	[4] In the description of angiomas we have followed the teaching of the
 42024	late John Duncan.
 42025	
 42026	Tumours of blood vessels may be divided, according to the nature of the
 42027	vessels of which they are composed, into the capillary, the venous, and
 42028	the arterial angiomas.
 42029	
 42030	
 42031	CAPILLARY ANGIOMA
 42032	
 42033	The most common form of capillary angioma is the naevus or congenital
 42034	telangiectasis.
 42035	
 42036	#Naevus.#--A naevus is a collection of dilated capillaries, the afferent
 42037	arterioles and the efferent venules of which often share in the
 42038	dilatation. Little is known regarding the _etiology_ of naevi beyond the
 42039	fact that they are of congenital origin. They often escape notice until
 42040	the child is some days old, but attention is usually drawn to them
 42041	within a fortnight of birth. For practical purposes the most useful
 42042	classification of naevi is into the cutaneous, the subcutaneous, and the
 42043	mixed forms.
 42044	
 42045	_The cutaneous naevus_, "mother's mark," or "port-wine stain," consists
 42046	of an aggregation of dilated capillaries in the substance of the skin.
 42047	On stretching the skin the vessels can be seen to form a fine network,
 42048	or to run in leashes parallel to one another. A dilated arteriole or a
 42049	vein winding about among the capillaries may sometimes be detected.
 42050	These naevi occur on any part of the body, but they are most frequently
 42051	met with on the face. They may be multiple, and vary greatly in size,
 42052	some being no bigger than a pin-head, while others cover large areas of
 42053	the body. In colour they present every tint from purple to brilliant
 42054	red; in the majority there is a considerable dash of blue, especially in
 42055	cold weather.
 42056	
 42057	Unlike the other forms of naevi, the cutaneous variety shows little
 42058	tendency to disappear, and it is especially persistent when associated
 42059	with overgrowth of the epidermis and of the hairs--_naevoid mole_.
 42060	
 42061	The _treatment_ of the cutaneous naevus is unsatisfactory, owing to the
 42062	difficulty of removing the naevus without leaving a scar which is even
 42063	more disfiguring. Very small naevi may be destroyed by a fine pointed
 42064	Paquelin thermo-cautery, or by escharotics, such as nitric acid. For
 42065	larger naevi, radium and solidified carbon dioxide ("CO_2 snow") may be
 42066	used. The extensive port-wine stains so often met with on the face are
 42067	best left alone.
 42068	
 42069	The _subcutaneous naevus_ is comparatively rare. It constitutes a
 42070	well-defined, localised tumour, which may possess a distinct capsule,
 42071	especially when it has ceased to grow or is retrogressing. On section,
 42072	it presents the appearance of a finely reticulated sponge.
 42073	
 42074	Although it may be noticed at, or within a few days of, birth, a
 42075	subcutaneous naevus is often overlooked, especially when on a covered
 42076	part of the body, and may not be discovered till the patient is some
 42077	years old. It forms a rounded, lobulated swelling, seldom of large size
 42078	and yielding a sensation like that of a sponge; the skin over it is
 42079	normal, or may exhibit a bluish tinge, especially in cold weather. In
 42080	some cases the tumour is diminished by pressing the blood out of it, but
 42081	slowly fills again when the pressure is relaxed, and it swells up when
 42082	the child struggles or cries. From a cold abscess it is diagnosed by the
 42083	history and progress of the swelling and by the absence of fluctuation.
 42084	When situated over one of the hernial openings, it closely simulates a
 42085	hernia; and when it occurs in the middle line of the face, head, or
 42086	back, it may be mistaken for such other congenital conditions as
 42087	meningocele or spina bifida. When other means fail, the use of an
 42088	exploring needle clears up the diagnosis.
 42089	
 42090	_Mixed Naevus._--As its name indicates, the mixed naevus partakes of the
 42091	characters of the other two varieties; that is, it is a subcutaneous
 42092	naevus with involvement of the skin.
 42093	
 42094	It is frequently met with on the face and head, but may occur on any
 42095	part of the body. It also affects parts covered by mucous membrane, such
 42096	as the cheek, tongue, and soft palate. The swelling is rounded or
 42097	lobulated, and projects beyond the level of its surroundings. Sometimes
 42098	the skin is invaded by the naevoid tissue over the whole extent of the
 42099	tumour, sometimes only over a limited area. Frequently the margin only
 42100	is of a bright-red colour, while the skin in the centre resembles a
 42101	cicatrix. The swelling is reduced by steady pressure, and increases in
 42102	size and becomes tense when the child cries.
 42103	
 42104	[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Mixed Naevus of Nose which was subsequently
 42105	cured by Electrolysis.]
 42106	
 42107	_Prognosis._--The rate of growth of the subcutaneous and mixed forms of
 42108	naevi varies greatly. They sometimes increase rapidly, especially during
 42109	the first few months of life; after this they usually grow at the same
 42110	rate as the child, or more slowly. There is a decided tendency to
 42111	disappearance of these varieties, fully 50 per cent. undergoing natural
 42112	cure by a process of obliteration, similar to the obliteration of
 42113	vessels in cicatricial tissue. This usually begins about the period of
 42114	the first dentition, sometimes at the second dentition, and sometimes at
 42115	puberty. On the other hand, an increased activity of growth may be shown
 42116	at these periods. The onset of natural cure is recognised by the tumour
 42117	becoming firmer and less compressible, and, in the mixed variety, by the
 42118	colour becoming less bright. Injury, infection, or ulceration of the
 42119	overlying skin may initiate the curative process.
 42120	
 42121	Towards adult life the spaces in a subcutaneous naevus may become greatly
 42122	enlarged, leading to the formation of a cavernous angioma.
 42123	
 42124	_Treatment._--In view of the frequency with which subcutaneous and mixed
 42125	naevi disappear spontaneously, interference is only called for when the
 42126	growth of the tumour is out of proportion to that of the child, or when,
 42127	from its situation--for example in the vicinity of the eye--any marked
 42128	increase in its size would render it less amenable to treatment.
 42129	
 42130	The methods of treatment most generally applicable are the use of radium
 42131	and carbon dioxide snow, igni-puncture, electrolysis, and excision.
 42132	
 42133	For naevi situated on exposed parts, where it is desirable to avoid a
 42134	scar, the use of _radium_ is to be preferred. The tube of radium is
 42135	applied at intervals t
